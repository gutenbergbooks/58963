THE PENNSYLVANIA PRISON SOCIETY<br />
</h2>

<p>The 124th Annual Meeting of “<span class="smcap">The Pennsylvania
Prison Society</span>” was held January 27, 1911, at the office of
the Society at the S. W. Corner of Fifth and Chestnut Streets,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The meeting was called to order by the President,
<span class="smcap">Joshua L. Baily</span>.</p>

<p>The Minutes of the 123d Annual Meeting were read and
approved.</p>

<p>Twenty-six members of the Society were present.</p>

<p>Reports were read from the Acting Committee and from
the General Agent, <span class="smcap">Fred. J. Pooley</span>, which were approved
and directed to be printed in the forthcoming <span class="smcap">Journal</span>.</p>

<p>The Treasurer, <span class="smcap">John Way</span>, produced a detailed statement
of the receipts and disbursements for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 1910. (See page 15.)</p>

<p>The following Amendment to the Constitution was proposed,
and directed to be laid before the next meeting of the
Society, <i>viz.</i>:</p>

<p>“The number of Members of the Acting Committee may
be increased to not exceeding sixty, provided the additional
members shall be residents of Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>“These Members may be elected from time to time at
any meeting of the Acting Committee, according to the provisions
of the By-Laws for filling vacancies, but the terms for
which they are elected shall be for the unexpired portion of
the current fiscal year only. These additional Members will
be eligible for reëlection at the next Annual Meeting, and their
respective terms of service shall then be assigned so as to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
coördinate with the terms of service of the other Members
of the Committee.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John J. Lytle</span>, on behalf of the Nominating Committee,
appointed at the last Annual Meeting, presented in writing the
nominations for the officers of the Society and for the members
of the Acting Committee whose terms expire at this time.
The President appointed as Tellers, <span class="smcap">Joseph C. Noblit</span>, <span class="smcap">A.
Jackson Wright</span> and <span class="smcap">William E. Tatum</span>. The election
having been duly conducted, the Tellers announced that a
unanimous vote of the Society was cast for the ballot as presented
by the Nominating Committee. (See page 3.)</p>

<p>The Nominating Committee proposed that <span class="smcap">Hon. William
N. Ashman</span> be elected Honorary Counselor. On motion the
recommendation of the Committee was adopted with expression
of appreciation of the long and faithful services of
<span class="smcap">Judge Ashman</span> for the Society.</p>

<p>The President appointed the following committee to
nominate to the next Annual Meeting the names of officers,
and members of the Acting Committee to fill the place of those
whose terms then expire, <i>viz.</i>: <span class="smcap">George S. Wetherell</span>,
<span class="smcap">Joseph C. Noblit</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Horace Fassitt</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Mary S.
Grigg</span> and <span class="smcap">Paul D. I. Maier</span>.</p>

<p>The President (Joshua L. Baily) expressed his appreciation
of the honor done him by his reëlection for a fifth
term. He said it was sixty years ago this month that he was
elected a member of the Prison Society. Soon thereafter he
was placed on the Acting Committee and for ten or twelve years
he was a regular visitor at the Eastern Penitentiary. He also
visited a number of our county jails and most of the penitentiaries
of the Atlantic States and some of those in the West. But
not being satisfied with the results, he gave up prison visiting
and took up what he then believed to be more hopeful service.</p>

<p>“Now, after the lapse of many years,” he said, “I find
myself again among you with a new vision as to the obligations
and possibilities of the work in which we are engaged.” In
the few recent years, he said, that he had had opportunity
for observation, he had not found the evidence that the prisons
of this state (perhaps with a few exceptions) are in any better
condition as to equipment and administration and facilities
for the improvement of the inmates than they were fifty
years ago.</p>

<p>“In all other lines of humanitarian and benevolent endeavor
there has been a wonderful augmentation of the efforts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
put forth, and the means provided, and with corresponding
beneficent results, but the work of prison reform has not kept
pace with what is so observable in other fields of service.</p>

<p>“People generally are not much interested in the inmates of
our prisons. They think that those who have committed
crimes should be punished, and so they should; but it is not
Christian to think that their criminality places them outside
the pale of human sympathy and help. Even some of the
greatest offenders may by kindness and good influences be
restored to society, as some have, and become exemplary and
useful citizens.</p>

<p>“I may not enlarge upon this subject at this time, but
I want to say to you that I know of no line of benevolent
activity that has a greater claim upon our intelligent and
hearty service.”</p>

<p>A. Jackson Wright expressed his concurrence in the views
of the President, especially as to this great opportunity which
our work offers for service in the cause of humanity.</p>

<h2 id="REPORT_OF_THE_ACTING_COMMITTEE">REPORT OF THE ACTING COMMITTEE<br />

<span class="medium smcap">For the Year 1910 to the Annual Meeting of the
Pennsylvania Prison Society.</span></h2>

<p>During the year 1910 the monthly meetings of the Acting
Committee have been regularly held with the usual exception
of two meetings of the summer months.</p>

<p>It has been a year of much interest and importance to
students of penology and especially to the active workers who
have charge of our prisons and reformatories.</p>

<h3>PROBATION FOR ADULTS.</h3>

<p>In the State of Pennsylvania the law providing for probation
or suspended sentences for adult offenders under the
care of probation officers, to whom reports must be made, has
been in effect for almost eighteen months. Very general approval
is expressed regarding the operation of this law. It is
believed to be a very efficient means of restoring those who
have lapsed from the right path to better methods of life and
to a deeper realization of their duties to society. They have
not become inoculated with the prison virus. The law applies
to certain classes of crimes and to first offenders. It is understood
that much of the efficiency of such a law depends on
the character and vigor of the probation officer, who should
be most earnest in presenting before such offenders higher
ideals of civic virtue.</p>

<h3>THE INDETERMINATE SENTENCE. PAROLE.</h3>

<p>Since the last annual report of this Committee, in the
State of Pennsylvania a system of parole for criminals sentenced
to the Eastern and to the Western Penitentiaries in accordance
with legislative enactment, went into effect. The act
provides that the court in pronouncing sentence shall state the
minimum and maximum limits thereof, with the understanding
that the minimum time of such imprisonment shall be
the minimum now or hereafter prescribed by statute for the
punishment of such offense, and that the maximum shall be
the maximum now or hereafter prescribed as the penalty.
Hence it does not follow, as has been supposed by many, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the minimum sentence is in every case one fourth of the maximum
sentence, though there is a provision that when there is
no minimum time prescribed by law, then the court shall impose
a minimum sentence, which is not to exceed one fourth
of the maximum time for the crime in question. Neither is
a prisoner entitled to release at the expiration of his minimum
sentence, unless it shall have appeared to the officers of the
prison and to the inspectors that the applicant for parole has
given evidence of being ready to become useful to the community.
The new law has not been in force for a period
sufficiently long to enable us to decide absolutely as to its
merits, yet, if we are to have confidence in reports from other
States which have tested such a law, we hope that a fair trying
out of its provisions will demonstrate its benefit both to
the convict and to society. The man or woman on parole by
the necessity of the conditions involved therewith must give
satisfaction until the maximum time for which he was sentenced
has expired, by which time we believe many of them
will have formed a habit of living decently and orderly.
Ex-Governor Hanly, of Indiana, acknowledges that when he
took office he felt great antagonism toward a law providing
for parole before the expiration of the conventional sentence,
but after closely observing the practical working of such system
of parole during his term of four years, he became an
enthusiastic advocate of the principle of the indeterminate sentence.
State after State, nation after nation, have been for
some years applying this principle in some form or other,
and now many intelligent jurists and administrators of prison
discipline have recognized that this element of the new penology
has come to stay. This method of reforming criminals,
moreover, was approved, after spirited discussion, by the late
International Prison Congress, held at Washington, D. C.,
October 2-8, 1910. This Congress was not composed of mere
theorists. Men of national and international renown as wardens
and superintendents of great prisons and reformatories took
part in the discussions and acquiesced in the conclusions.
Warden Benham, of the New York State Penitentiary at Auburn,
regards the indeterminate sentence as a leading influence
in the process of reforming the lives of those who have fallen.
By some jurists in this and other States, fears have been expressed
with regard to the practical service and to the execution
of such a system of curtailed punishment. It is quite possible
that experience may show that in this State some modification
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
of the existing law may at some time be adopted, but
great care should be exercised lest the reforming possibilities
of the act should be weakened. It is to be hoped that a full
opportunity may be given to observe the effects of this law,
the essential principles of which are the same as have been
found successful in other States.</p>

<p>The reports from those who have been paroled within the
last year in this State are so far very encouraging.</p>

<p>Parole Officer John Egan of the Western Penitentiary
reports on the first day of the current year that there were
twenty-three under his charge on parole, and that the reports
from them were with one exception satisfactory. There were
ten then confined in the Western Penitentiary who were proper
subjects for parole provided sponsors and employment could
be obtained for them.</p>

<p>Full statistics from the Eastern Penitentiary have not
been obtained. About thirty had been paroled by the end of
last year from whom satisfactory reports had been received.
About the same number were awaiting decisions from the
Board of Pardons.</p>

<h3>WORK OF GENERAL AGENT.</h3>

<p>We desire to commend to the special attention of the Society
and to the public, the efficient work of our General Agent,
Fred. J. Pooley.</p>

<p>He has been constantly engaged in giving counsel to
the prisoners, and particular attention to them at the
time of their release. A large number of cases have been investigated,
and where there have appeared to be mitigating
circumstances, or where some relative or judicious friend has
agreed to stand as sponsor, a remission or suspension of the
sentence has been obtained from the court. We have heard
of no instance in which such favor has been abused. In one
month of the last year over one hundred arrested and accused
persons were discharged without receiving the stigma of a
convicted felon. In the latter part of the autumn the privilege
of an interview at the Central Station with the prisoners who
have been committed to the County Prison after a hearing before
the magistrates, was accorded to our General Agent by
the Director of Public Safety. In order that he may thus
occupy this very promising field for service, the Secretary has
assumed a portion of the duties at the Eastern Penitentiary
which had formerly been under the care of the agent. A full
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
report of the work of the agent will be presented at the Annual
Meeting, and will be printed in the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>.</p>

<h3>COMMITTEE ON EASTERN PENITENTIARY.</h3>

<p>Reports of the various members of this Committee show
that besides a considerable number of visits that have not been
reported, 6,130 visits to prisoners have been made during the
past year. Some of our members have participated in the
gospel services at the Penitentiary. We are firmly of the opinion
that this work of visitation, which has been carried on by this
Society for nearly a century and a quarter has been very helpful,
although from the nature of the circumstances accurate
statistics cannot be presented. The officials of the Penitentiary
manifestly sympathize with the objects of these visits. Cleanliness
and good order characterize the various departments
of this large prison, to which ends a general overhauling of
the plumbing with other improvements have been made conducive.
A new three-story block, containing one hundred
and twenty cells is in process of construction, and it is quite
gratifying to report that nearly all the work of construction
is being done by the prisoners. This affords employment for
from one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty prisoners.
While some other prisoners have employment in weaving,
knitting stockings, chair seating and in helping in the kitchen
and laundry, still many of them spend a large portion of their
time in enforced idleness. This is a condition which is conducive
to most serious evils, since it is liable to affect their
entire career after they have left the prison walls. Is the State
justified in forcing these unfortunate human beings to remain
idle year after year? Should we not rather use every means
in our power to prepare them for useful citizenship?</p>

<p>Reports of the agent show that 333 prisoners have been
supplied at the time of their discharge with suits either entirely
or in part. We are increasing our efforts to find positions for
such as need employment.</p>

<p>The warden, Robert J. McKenty, is untiring in efforts to
promote the welfare of those under his charge. To him and
to the other officials the members of the Committee are under
obligation for the facilities afforded in making their visits.</p>

<h3>PRISONS AT MOYAMENSING AND HOLMESBURG.</h3>

<p>Our General Agent is unremitting in his endeavors to
assist those confined in the prisons of the City of Philadelphia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
The ladies of the Committee to visit the women prisoners
at Moyamensing have been faithful in looking after their
interests. Situations have been found for many, and not a
few have been restored to their families. In all, 6,707 visits
have been made to the inmates of the County Prisons.</p>

<p>We take pleasure in reporting that striped clothing as a
distinctive prison garb was relinquished, except as a punishment
for misbehavior, at the Holmesburg Prison on the first
day of July, 1910. Gradually both in this country and England
this ancient custom is being dropped. This is a further
indication of the growing belief that the convict, after all, is
a human being, and does not need the degradation of stripes
in order to be distinguished from the rest of humanity.</p>

<h3>COUNTY JAILS.</h3>

<p>The Western Penitentiary and the Allegheny County
Prison have been regularly visited by one of our committees,
and there has also been regular visitation of some of the
county jails. The evidence afforded that this service has
been acceptable and useful has been encouraging to us, and
arrangements are being made for its extension to other parts
of the state.</p>

<p>There is need of continual agitation to educate the public
with regard to the necessity of some change in the administration
of many of the smaller county jails of the State. They
furnish little or no employment, herd a miscellaneous lot of
lawbreakers in entire idleness, often keep the young and the
old, the suspected, who may be innocent, and the hardened
criminals in the same apartments, and thus become hotbeds
for the dissemination of vice and lawlessness. We have already
in these reports spoken of the usefulness of establishing
district workhouses where employment can be furnished
and where habits of industry may be engendered. The labor
of the prisoners should so far contribute to the maintenance
of the jails as to relieve the counties from the chief part of
this burden. Sooner or later, we believe, all our States will
adopt some such plan, and why should not the legislators of
this great commonwealth give some earnest attention to the
improvement of the county jails? Already we have in this
State an institution which in many respects could be taken
as a model for an industrial penal establishment. We refer to
the Allegheny County Workhouse at Hoboken, Pennsylvania.
Without infringing on the present laws of the State respecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
prison labor, they give employment to all the prisoners. Located
on a large farm, they supply their tables with vegetables
from their own gardens and often have a surplus for the
market. When new buildings are constructed, most of the
work is done by the convicts. They have those who have
been sentenced to terms of from twenty days to some years,
and without difficulty they find work for all of them.</p>

<p>The legislature of Massachusetts has been considering
a measure contemplating the establishment of such a system
of district workhouses. It is quite possible that the State
of Indiana may enact a measure of this kind within the next
two years. Let Pennsylvania move forward in this work.</p>

<h3>VISITS OF THE PRESIDENT.</h3>

<p>The President of the Society has made visits to the
Eastern Penitentiary, and to some of the County Jails of
Pennsylvania. He has also visited the Maryland Penitentiary
and the city jail of Baltimore; and has made two visits to
the United States jail at Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>In the Washington jail and at the Maryland Penitentiary,
he addressed the assembled convicts at their respective
Sabbath afternoon chapel services.</p>

<h3>THE PRISON CONGRESSES.</h3>

<p>An event of great interest to all students of penology and
of far-reaching influence in prison administration all over the
world, was the quinquennial meeting of the International
Prison Congress, which this year held its sessions in Washington,
D. C. This occasion brought together jurists, superintendents
of prisons and reformatories, eminent lawyers and
philanthropic workers from thirty-four different countries of
the world. Ninety delegates were enrolled from foreign countries.
Not only were the conclusions of this Congress of
importance, but the social intermingling of so many earnest
men and women in a common cause had an equal value. The
American Prison Congress also held its sessions in Washington,
D. C., for two days prior to the opening of the International
meeting. It was a notable gathering, and while its
proceedings were weighty and not to be overlooked, yet it
was somewhat overshadowed by the great interest felt in the
International assemblage, as the latter was attended by so
many who had already beyond the seas distinguished themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
as students of penological problems, and as practical
administrators of prisons.</p>

<p>The Acting Committee deemed the conclusions of the International
Prison Congress and the proceedings of the American
Prison Congress of such immediate interest and importance
as to justify the issue of a supplement to our Journal, which
should contain these conclusions and proceedings. In this supplement
were included an article by President Baily on the
Eastern Penitentiary and the account of the Pennsylvania
Prison Society which was prepared by the Secretary for publication
in one of the bulletins issued by the International Congress
during its sessions. Three thousand copies were printed
and distributed.</p>

<h3>OBITUARIES.</h3>

<p>The deaths of John H. Dillingham and David Sulzberger,
both occurring near the same time in early spring, removed
two valuable members from your Committee. Appropriate
notices of the life and faithful labors of each of these have
been prepared and read in our meetings, and it is proposed to
publish them in the forthcoming number of our Journal.</p>

<p>Our prayers and sympathy go out to all who have the
oversight of those offenders, whom society, for its own protection
and for the reformation of the sinner, declares must
be debarred from freedom. Upon these officials devolves the
duty not only of restraining the criminals within physical
bounds, but&mdash;what is their chief mission&mdash;of implanting in
their charges incentives for a change in their attitude in society.
They should endeavor to inspire them with some sense
of self-confidence and self-respect, so that they may be prepared
to face the world with new aims and a spirit of hopefulness.
The Pennsylvania Prison Society has from its inception
desired to work in harmony with the administrators, and
we trust has been comparatively free from the errors of a
misdirected zeal. In another year this Society shall have
rounded out a century and a quarter of existence. While we
may contemplate with a good degree of satisfaction the achievements
of past years, we are aware that in some lines progress
has been slow, but we trust under Divine guidance to go on
with the work with greater zeal and consecration.</p>

<h2 id="GENERAL_AGENTS_REPORT">GENERAL AGENT’S REPORT.</h2>

<p>Another year has passed and it becomes my duty to
present to you a report of the work of the General Agent.
During the past year I have visited over 6,000 men and women
in the prisons in Philadelphia, and talked to them of the past
and the future. I feel that much good has been accomplished
and that while it is impossible to measure the amount of good
accomplished by any fixed rule, yet there is evidence in all
directions that the seed sown in the Master’s name is bearing
fruit abundantly. All over this broad land of ours, in every
prison may be found the lost son or daughter; it gives the
world but little concern so long as it is some one else’s son
or daughter who occupies a prison cell. Go through the prisons
of our State and nine times out of every ten the prisoners will
tell you they never would have thought of getting into prison;
in a moment of temptation they fell and the world turns from
them when the walls of the prison separates them from the
outer world. My experience has taught me that if we were
more sympathetic, more interested in fallen humanity, there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
would be less of crime. One Sabbath afternoon I visited a
prison in western Pennsylvania. I arrived at the prison just
about the time for service. As I was a member of the Pennsylvania
Prison Society I was requested to say a few words
to the men and women. My remarks were brief, and I closed
with, “Your mother or wife, or sister is praying for you to-day,
and when you leave your prison cell, go home to your
mother, your wife, or to your sister; go back to your church,
and God will bless and help you to be a better man or woman.”
One prisoner went to his cell weeping. I followed him to his
cell and said to him, “Brother, why do you weep?” and he
answered, “When you said ‘mother’ it touched a tender spot,
and when I leave here I will go right home to her and will
be a better man.”</p>

<p>Scattered over the ocean there are many pieces of wreckage
floating in different directions, first carried by one current
and then by another; they are simply drifting. They have
no purpose; they are afraid to trust themselves. I believe it
to be our duty to bring to these men and women in prison
the strongest force we know, the power of love. Faith is a
great power; so is hope; but charity, or love, is the greatest.
Geologists tell us that the silent influences of the atmosphere
are far more powerful than the noisy forces of nature. Quiet
sunshine is mightier than the thunder, and gentle rain influences
the earth more than an earthquake. Guided by this
gentleness and faith, I have tried to be the instrument in
God’s hands of leading some poor souls to the path which
leads to happiness and peace. It will probably be of interest
to know something of the work of the General Agent at the
Eastern State Penitentiary.</p>

<p>From January 1 to December 1, 1910: 493 prisoners
were discharged: to these were given 298 suits of clothing,
382 hats, 301 shirts, 425 suspenders and neckties and 321
suits of underclothes.</p>

<p>In addition tools, etc., have been provided for several
of these prisoners.</p>

<p>On December 1, 1910, Secretary Albert H. Votaw took
charge of the work of the Pennsylvania Prison Society at the
Eastern State Penitentiary in consequence of your General
Agent having other duties at the Central Police Station, City
Hall. I desire to thank the Inspectors, Warden, Chaplain and
all the officials connected with the Eastern Penitentiary for
assistance rendered me in the performance of my official duties.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>Since October 1, 1898, I have made regular visits to
Moyamensing Prison and the Philadelphia County Prison at
Holmesburg. During 1910 more than 600 discharged prisoners
were assisted with railroad tickets, board, lodging, room
rent, tools, etc., and more than 700 letters written to relatives
and friends at a distance, thus getting them quickly in touch
with folks at home, and in many cases resulting in acquittal
at court when a prisoner’s good record was shown. The
Inspectors, Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent, Prison
Agent and Matron, and all connected with the prison have
rendered me every possible assistance, which I more than appreciate.
The commitments to Moyamensing Prison during
1910 were as follows:</p>

  </tr></table>

<p>From October 1, 1909, to September 30, 1910, 914
prisoners were sent to the County Prison at Holmesburg
and 867 prisoners were discharged.</p>

<p>A glance at the above figures will show what a wonderful
field of work there is for the Prison Agent and General Agent
of the Pennsylvania Prison Society.</p>

<p>For the past two years I have felt very strongly the importance
of visiting the prisoners at the Central Station, City
Hall. The reason for this desire was brought about through
a young man who was held in Moyamensing Prison on suspicion
of larceny for a further hearing. I had a talk with
him and he told me he left Louisville, Ky., seventeen years
since, and had not written home in that time, and now he felt
ashamed to write. After a long talk with him, he consented
to let me write. When the letter came from the mother telling
of her joy at the news of her long-lost son, whom she had
long thought dead, I at once went to the prison and found
the man had that morning been discharged&mdash;<i>the letter came
too late</i>. Had I met the man when he was first arrested, that
letter would have arrived before the second hearing, and upon
his discharge he would have gone home.</p>

<p>It is with much pleasure I am able to state that on November
16, 1910, Director Clay granted me permission to visit the
cell room at City Hall and directed the Superintendent of
Police to issue me a permit, which reads as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p class="caption">

<p>Permission is hereby granted Frederick J. Pooley, General
Agent Pennsylvania Prison Society, the courtesy and
privilege of visiting prisoners in Central Station committed
to County Prison.</p>

<p class="author">
(Signed) <span class="smcap">John B. Taylor</span>,<br />
<i>Superintendent of Police</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Since receiving permission I have made daily visits to
the Central Station and have written 126 letters to different
parts of the country. One letter brought a young man’s father
from Johnstown, Pa., and another from Richmond, Va., and
when the cases came to court they were discharged. At the
request of the Detective Department three women who were
found on the street without a home were placed in care of
Mrs. H. Fassitt, and Mrs. Fassitt had them sent to the Door
of Blessing, and afterwards had one woman sent to her home
in West Virginia and another to her home in Maryland, and
the other to a hospital for treatment. In some cases the magistrates
have requested me to look into the case, and upon my
report they were discharged and sent home. I look for wonderful
results from this field of work. Only the other day a
man came to me and said, “We had not heard from sister for
five months and had it not been for your talk with her at
the City Hall we do not know when she would have decided
to come home.” I think the words of our President, Joshua
L. Baily, to the Magistrate when he visited the City Hall recently
explains the new work of the Pennsylvania Prison Society
when he said. “Our new work here is to try to keep
men and women from going to prison.” The Magistrates and
officials of the City Hall are doing all they can to help to
make the work of your General Agent a success.</p>

<p>The thanks of the members of the Pennsylvania Prison
Society are due to the following for sending magazines and
religious papers for the prisoners: Rev. R. H. Barnes, Louis

William A. Davis, Mrs. Charles Chauncey, Miss A. M.
Johnson, Robert P. Nicholson, Estelle A. King, C. Langenstein,
Anna M. Tarr, Miss M. Louisa Baker, C. deB. L. Bright,
Mrs. R. T. Taylor and Friends’ Institute. Thanks are also
due John J. Lytle for several hundred copies of <i>Sabbath Reading</i>
which have been sent weekly to Eastern Penitentiary,
Moyamensing and County Prison, Holmesburg. In addition
I have recently received, through the kindness of Dr. Beverley
Robinson, of New York City, $25.00 from Mrs. Charles
Chauncey, and from Mrs. A. Sydney Biddle the same amount
to help along the work, and from Mr. Emlen Hutchinson,
Chairman of the Board of Inspectors Philadelphia County
Prison, $60.00 with which to send home runaway boys. These
amounts have been handed to our Treasurer for use when
necessary.</p>

<p>I feel the work that the Pennsylvania Prison Society is
doing is becoming more appreciated as the years roll on.
With much faith in the future of our Society,</p>

<h2 id="PENAL_LEGISLATION_IN_PENNSYLVANIA">PENAL LEGISLATION IN PENNSYLVANIA.</h2>

<p>After the hopeful beginning in improved penal legislation
made by the Legislature of Pennsylvania two years ago
in the enactment of a probation, indeterminate sentence and
parole law, the work done and left undone by the recent session
is, to say the least, most discouraging. Not only did a
number of admirable bills receive no consideration whatever,
but the law referred to above, which the Committee on Criminal
Law Reform in its report at the last Prison Congress
(Washington, 1910) pronounced “admirable,” was so amended
as virtually to eliminate from it the vital principle underlying
the indeterminate sentence and parole.</p>

<p>The act of 1909 was based on a very careful study of the
writings of the most advanced penologists, and of the statutes
of those progressive states that have introduced the indeterminate
sentence and parole with the largest measure of success.
Its viewpoint was that of those who seek the reformation of
the wrongdoer, and not of those who still have in their minds
the old idea of retributive justice only; it made a break with
the old codes, aimed to deal with the man and not with his
crime, and had regard to his future rather than to his past;
and possibly this radical departure from the traditional mode
of thought and procedure, and the introduction of something
evidently so new to many legal minds in Pennsylvania, though
no longer so in some other States, was responsible for the
hostility which the law encountered here and there.</p>

<p>Section 6 of said law reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Whenever any person, convicted in any court of this Commonwealth
of any crime, shall be sentenced to imprisonment in either the Eastern or
Western Penitentiary, the court, instead of pronouncing upon such convict
a definite or fixed term of imprisonment, shall pronounce upon such convict
a sentence of imprisonment for an indefinite term; stating in such sentence
the minimum and maximum limits thereof; fixing as the minimum
time of such imprisonment, the term now or hereafter prescribed as the
minimum imprisonment for the punishment of such offense; but if there
be no minimum time so prescribed, the court shall determine the same,
but it shall not exceed one fourth of the maximum time, and the maximum
limit shall be the maximum time now or hereafter prescribed as a
penalty for such offense: Provided, however, That when a person shall
have twice before been convicted, sentenced and imprisoned in a penitentiary
for a term of not less than one year, for any crime committed in this
State, or elsewhere within the limits of the United States, the court shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
sentence said person to a maximum of thirty years: And provided further,
That no person sentenced for an indeterminate term shall be entitled to
any benefits under the act, entitled ‘An act providing for the commutation
of sentences for good behavior of convicts in prisons, penitentiaries,
workhouses, and county jails in this State, and regulations governing the
same,’ approved the eleventh day of May, Anno Domini one thousand nine
hundred and one.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This section has been amended to read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Whenever any person, convicted in any court of this Commonwealth
of any crime, shall be sentenced to imprisonment in any penitentiary of
the State, the court, instead of pronouncing upon such convict a definite
or fixed term of imprisonment, shall pronounce upon such convict a sentence
of imprisonment for an indefinite term; stating in such sentence the
minimum and maximum limits thereof; and the maximum limit shall
never exceed the maximum time now or hereafter prescribed as a penalty
for such offense: Provided, That no person sentenced for an indeterminate
term shall be entitled to any benefits under the act, entitled ‘An
act providing for the commutation of sentences for good behavior of
convicts in prisons, penitentiaries, workhouses and county jails in this
State, and regulations governing the same,’ approved the eleventh day of
May, Anno Domini one thousand nine hundred and one.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be seen that this amendment puts it into the
power of the <i>court</i> to fix <i>any</i> minimum below the maximum,
instead of a minimum not exceeding one fourth of the maximum;
that it permits the court to name a lower maximum
than the one now prescribed by law for any given offense;
and that it strikes out the thirty-year clause altogether.</p>

<p>The practical effect of the former change is to destroy in
great measure the value and efficacy of the indeterminate
sentence as a remedial and reformatory measure. In other
words, the amendment restores the vicious <i>inequality of sentences</i>,
which is always so apt to breed a feeling of injustice
and resentment in the one convicted, and which therefore
greatly unfits him as a subject for reformatory treatment. It
proceeds upon the long-accepted but false assumption that the
court can in every case determine the exact degree of culpability
and then adjust the punishment accurately to the crime.
This is not only absurd, but it is impossible. A Solomon with
all his wisdom could not have done this! As the law now
stands, we shall again find, as is indeed already the case, that
the same court or adjoining courts may, even under practically
identical conditions, impose greatly varying sentences, instead
of putting all upon whom sentence is passed on an equality
and giving all, under identical conditions, an equal chance,
as the law originally contemplated. Thus since the amended
law went into effect sentences like these have been pronounced:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Minimum 5 years, maximum 7; minimum 8 years, maximum
10; minimum 6 months, maximum 1 year; minimum
6 years, maximum 7; minimum 7 years, maximum 15. In
two cases of burglary the one man received a minimum of
5 years, and a maximum of 10, but the other a minimum of
only 2 years and a maximum of 5; while in another case an
old crook, who had been convicted for the sixth time, and
whose new crimes should have brought him a maximum sentence
of 16 years, received a minimum of 3 months and a
maximum of 1 year. Since the law first went into effect several
courts have also imposed flat sentences, without a minimum.
This is clearly in conflict with the law, which is mandatory.
It does seem as if courts that try and sentence lawbreakers
should be the first to have a reverent regard for law!</p>

<p>Again, under the amended law the <i>court</i> virtually determines
when a prisoner shall be eligible to parole. This is,
however, utterly subversive of the theory upon which the indeterminate
sentence is based, namely, that <i>parole is to be granted
when a prisoner is believed to be fit to be restored to society
as a law-abiding citizen</i>. The time when this may be done no
court under the sun can fix, but only those who have the
prisoner in charge and under observation, and even they may
make mistakes. In the argument on the amended bill before
the Senate Committee, it was said by those who opposed the
original law, that it conferred judicial functions on the Penitentiary
Boards, and that there was not a State in the Union
whose statutes prescribed both the maximum and the minimum.
But it was shown that under the laws relating to the
Huntingdon Reformatory the courts in imposing sentence do
not fix the duration thereof, but that the Board of Managers
is authorized to terminate the sentence at its discretion, provided
the detention shall not exceed the maximum of the term
assigned by law for the offense of which the prisoner was convicted;
also, that in many States, such as Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota
and others, the minimum as well as the maximum sentence
to the state prison is fixed by law. It seems strange,
indeed, that those who opposed the law of 1909 should have
forgotten the law as regards Huntingdon; and that they should
have been totally ignorant of the laws of other States on a
subject that is to-day receiving the serious attention of many
of the most thoughtful minds the world over!</p>

<p>On the benefits of a just and equal indeterminate sentence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Dr. Frederick Howard Wines, one of the best informed
and most eminent penologists in the United States, expresses
himself as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There is not, and in the nature of things there cannot be, any aid to
a truly reformatory discipline like that afforded by the indeterminate
sentence. Every prison official can testify to the dissatisfaction and unrest
caused by the palpable inequality of sentences; an inequality which neither
the legislature nor the courts can avoid or correct. The only equal sentence
is the indeterminate sentence, with an identical maximum for all
who violate a given section of the code, coupled with identical conditions
by which to reduce it to the minimum <i>prescribed by law</i>. Its imposition
removes all ground for complaint on this score. It also puts an end to
the fallacious hope of an unconditional pardon. The prisoner is given to
understand that the date of his release on parole depends entirely upon
himself. The authorities desire his release and will help him to earn
it; they are not his enemies, but his friends. This disarms him of his
hostility to them. He is in a favorable state of mind to receive treatment,
and is disposed to yield obedience to them, if they keep their
promise to him. This leads to coöperation in the effort made for his
restoration, without which a cure cannot be effected. The hope of an
early release sustains him under the depressing influence of prison life
and stimulates him to exert himself to avoid losing whatever he has
gained by diligence and good conduct. He is aided to form habits of
industry and obedience, which tend to become fixed. He is trained and
transformed.</p>

<p>“Under the indeterminate sentence the prison itself undergoes a
gradual process of transformation. The moment that reformation rather
than punishment becomes the watchword of the administration, a new
spirit takes possession of it. The governor chooses better and abler men
to govern it&mdash;men imbued with reformatory ideas and qualified to exert
a reformatory influence; men of higher education, purer moral character,
broader culture, loftier aims in life, greater devotion to their work.
These wardens of the new school grow stronger with the passing years;
their habit of opposition to everything that is low or crooked or mean or
vile lifts them to higher and still higher levels. Failure to show reformatory
results means failure in their chosen profession. They have a new
responsibility, and they rise to meet it. They are open to every suggestion
that can be of service to them in the accomplishment of their difficult
task, a task from which an angel might shrink, and in which an angel
might rejoice.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The thirty-year clause of the act of 1909 was designed to
protect society against the professional criminal. It is another
absurdity of our criminal procedure that we release such
periodically to renew their depredations on society. A dangerously
insane person we put away until he is cured; and if he
is never cured he is never released. We guard society against
the contagion of certain virulent diseases. But when the
habitual criminal has every now and then squared himself with
the State by serving a term in the penitentiary, we again give
him his freedom, though he may have hatched out another
plot even before he leaves his place of confinement. Some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
other States have grown wiser. New York and Indiana sentence
the habitual criminal for life on a third or fourth conviction;
Connecticut to thirty years on a third conviction;
but in Pennsylvania a thirty-year sentence, with a minimum
not exceeding seven years and a half, seems to have been
considered too drastic. Better let society suffer than the
criminal!</p>

<p>In amending the law of 1909, which, under its intelligent
administration for two years was yielding most happy results,
Pennsylvania has clearly been compelled to take a backward
step. There was no public demand for a change; those
charged with the administration of the law did not desire a
change, but opposed it; and there is ample ground for the
belief that the change was inspired by reasons of a purely
private and personal character.</p>

<p>Nor is the last Legislature to be commended for what it
failed to do.</p>

<p>In his report of November 10, 1909, Mr. Bromley Wharton,
General Agent and Secretary of the Board of Public
Charities, called attention to the needs of the county jails in
these words: “This is a matter which has received serious
attention at the hands of your Board. The prevailing system
of government of the county jails is, in many respects, unsatisfactory.
In most of the counties the jails are in charge
of the sheriff, who, as a rule, knows little or nothing of
hygiene or sanitation. Few jails have yards for exercise,
or workshops, which results in the prisoners loafing in the corridors,
smoking and playing cards. The filthy and unsanitary
condition of some of the jails causes the long-term prisoners
to welcome their transfer to the penitentiary.”</p>

<p>At the subsequent session of the Legislature a bill, approved
by the Board, was introduced designed to remedy the
unsatisfactory and often disgraceful conditions existing in the
prisons of various counties, and placing the control and management
of all the county prisons and jails and the inmates
thereof in Boards of Prison Inspectors to be named by the
courts, one inspector to be a physician, and another, if desired,
a woman. This carefully drawn bill, which, if it had
become a law, would have inaugurated a most salutary reform
where it is most needed in our penal system, passed the House,
but was killed in the Senate. It was re-introduced in the last
Legislature, but never even came out of committee.</p>

<p>A joint resolution, likewise approved by the Board of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Charities, providing for the appointment of a commission to
consider and report upon the advisability of establishing a
state system of workhouses for misdemeanants, so that county
jails and prisons could be used solely for the imprisonment
of persons awaiting trial or otherwise detained, and for convicts
sentenced to brief terms, met a similar fate. So also
an act authorizing the pensioning of deserving superannuated
employés of penal, reformatory and charitable institutions of
the State.</p>

<p>Another bill, strongly approved by the Board, but which
after its introduction never again saw the light of day, provided
for the establishing of a State Reformatory for Women
between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one. That such an
institution is most urgently needed is only too well known to
charity workers throughout the State. It is almost incredible
that such a wealthy and otherwise progressive State like
Pennsylvania should be considered too poor to make at least
a beginning of an institution of this kind. Were the people of
this Commonwealth familiar with the work done and the results
achieved by such an institution as the Massachusetts
Reformatory Prison for Women, they would compel their
legislators to take action. Great movements in behalf of the
social welfare can after all be carried through only when there
is an intelligent, widespread and persistent public sentiment
behind them.</p>

<p>The one progressive penal act for which the last Legislature
deserves credit is the bill “providing for the selection
and purchase, or the appropriation from State forest reserves,
of a tract of land and the erection thereon of buildings for the
Western Penitentiary; making an appropriation therefor;
authorizing the removal thereto of the inmates of the said
penitentiary, and directing the sale of the site now occupied
by the said penitentiary, and the buildings and materials
thereon.” This is in line with the recommendation of the
Board of Charities, which, in its preliminary report for the
years 1911-12, called renewed attention to the very unsatisfactory
conditions surrounding the Western Penitentiary, and
strongly urged its removal to some large tract of land in a
rural section, so that labor, not in conflict with existing laws,
might be provided for the inmates. In pursuing this course
Pennsylvania will only be doing what some other States have
already done or are about doing; and it is to be hoped that
in due time similar provision will be made for the eastern part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
of the State. Might it not be well to keep in mind, however,
the need of a central state prison for the confinement of
habitual criminals, so that the two penitentiaries now in existence
could be used only for first-termers? This would make
the reformatory process contemplated by the indeterminate
sentence infinitely easier.</p>

<p>Another bill of extremely doubtful utility passed by the
last Legislature, authorizes the judges of the courts of quarter
sessions and the courts of oyer and terminer, after due inquiry,
to release on parole any convict confined in the county jail
or workhouse of their respective districts, and place him or
her in charge of and under the supervision of a designated
probation officer. County jails as now conducted are not reformatory
institutions.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this survey that Pennsylvania is not
making rapid progress in improved penal legislation; nor is
it likely that we can hope for better things until some future
Legislature will see fit to empower the Board of Charities or
a specially appointed commission of expert penologists to
devise a carefully articulated and homogeneous system of
penal and reformatory institutions for the State. Such a
system should provide for a radical change in the construction,
management and internal administration of the county prisons;
it should include a state system of workhouses, a woman’s
reformatory, a central penitentiary for recidivists, and a favorably
located institution for criminals suffering from tuberculosis
or dementia, where they could receive skillful treatment;
it should make a strict separation between habitual
criminals and first offenders, between young delinquents and
those of mature years; and it should everywhere introduce
approved reformatory methods, and make it possible to give
those in confinement ample indoor and outdoor employment.
It might, of course, be objected that a system so carefully
planned and wrought out would be too expensive; but let it
never be forgotten that in the end it is far better for the State,
and indeed cheaper, to make <i>men</i> than to arrest, try and support
criminals, and suffer the results of their depredations.</p>

<p>Twenty-four pages of the Report are devoted to “Criminal
Histories” of sixty-four prisoners received during 1910
who had previously served one or more terms in this penitentiary
(a considerable number of them in other penitentiaries
or prisons), and who are reported as “illustrations of
persistency in courses of crime, indicating the growth of a
permanent class, calling for the most serious consideration.”</p>

<p>There is also a record of forty-three prisoners received
in 1910 who have relatives in this penitentiary or in other
prisons.</p>

<p>The inspectors refer with satisfaction to the new building
of concrete construction containing one hundred and twenty
cells “now rapidly nearing completion,” and say “the plumbing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
steam fitting and electrical work needed is under the care of
experts, and furnishing the opportunity of training many of
our inmates for future positions of usefulness and trust.”</p>

<p>Report is made that the library now contains 12,057
bound volumes, 852 of them in foreign languages, and that
66,887 books were taken out by the prisoners in the course of
the year. A bookbinding and printing room affords employment
to several prisoners; 1,419 books were bound and 743,248
pages of matter were printed for the various purposes of
the penitentiary.</p>

<p>A school has been maintained for those classed as “illiterates,”
and instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic
given to 346 prisoners. The inspectors acknowledge the honor
done them “by the visits of distinguished representatives of
the prison systems and state departments of the nations of
Europe, Asia and South America, with others of Canada and
our own country, who were in attendance at the recent International
Prison Congress in Washington.”</p>

<p>Grateful recognition is also made of “the valuable services
of the visitors of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, the American
Society for Visiting Catholic Prisoners, the Protestant
Episcopal City Mission and the Prisoners’ Guild of the King’s
Daughters, contributing to the comfort, encouragement and
upbuilding of the prisoners,” and especial mention is made of
the services of the Pennsylvania Prison Society in providing
clothing for those prisoners in need at the time of their discharge.</p>

<p>The cost of maintenance for the year 1910 is reported
as $99,296.70, and the following is presented as “Account
With Convicts for 1910”:</p>

<h2>REVIEW OF THE BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE INSPECTORS
OF THE STATE PENITENTIARY
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
FOR THE YEARS 1910-1911.</h2>

<p>This report is contained in a pamphlet of one hundred
and sixteen pages, of which about twenty pages are devoted
to a historical account of the institution.</p>

<p>It appears that the first buildings were completed November
22, 1827, and on the supposition that very soon after
prisoners were received at the institution, its penal history
covers more than eighty-three years.</p>

<p>The statistics show that on January 1, 1910, the number
of convicts was 1,261.</p>

good deportment of our indeterminately sentenced inmates,
their sincere efforts to map out for themselves a future foreign

which all, save two, of the convicts who have been granted
conditional freedom are complying with the provisions of
their parole, is gratifying.”</p>

<p>During the year the sales of mats and matting amounted
to $114,475.00.</p>

<p>The profit from this industry was $29,696.00.</p>

<p>The profit in the hosiery department was $5,191.00.</p>

<p>The profit in the shoe department was $1,665.00.</p>

<p>The earnings by labor, piece price, in the broom department,
$4,069.00.</p>

<p>It appears that the officials make effort to find work for
the large majority of the convicts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>The number of days of labor reported by those in fair
health is 275,051.</p>

<p>The number of days of idleness seems large, 85,074,
but indicates that the convicts are at work a little over three
fourths of the time.</p>

<p>They now have a regular optical department equipped
with modern appliances, and in 1910 386 prisoners were fitted
with glasses. The physician reports that in many instances
those who were thus supplied showed both physical and mental
improvement, to say nothing of the satisfaction of having
deficiencies of eyesight remedied.</p>

<p>The chaplain reports that the number of bound volumes
in the library is 11,882. During the year the number of books
issued to the prisoners was 73,070.</p>

<p>The report contains resolutions of the Board of Inspectors
<i>in memoriam</i> of John Linn Milligan, whose mission since
1863 had been in looking after the spiritual interests of the
inmates of the Western Penitentiary. The following paragraph
from one of his recent reports illustrates the spirit of
the man and of his work: “Since my official relation with this
prison began, 11,624 convicted men have passed within these
gates. Many of these have gone out to struggle into the cold
and suspicious world, friendless and alone, to struggle against
the handicap that conviction and punishment of crime bring.
Doubtless many have died, bruised under the burdens they
have had to bear. Doubtless many more than the public believes
have been absorbed into the ranks of industrial honesty
of life and purpose. A small per cent. were instinctive and
professional criminals, and nothing but the sovereign grace
and mercy of the good Lord, who said to the poor sinner in
the face of the murderous crowd, ‘Neither do I condemn thee;
go, sin no more,’ could cure the crime habit for them.</p>

<p>“When I look back along the line of the regiment of convicted
criminals, whom I have tried to strengthen with a new
and manly purpose, the busy efforts do not seem long, nor
has my knowledge and familiarity with their character hardened
my heart nor diminished my desire to uplift them. Nor
has the backward glance lessened my hope in true reformative
efforts, patient, firm and kind, and I believe more sincerely
in the deep necessity of Divine love and power for their spiritual
reclamation.”</p>

<p>Warden Francies earnestly recommends that immediate
steps be taken to remove the prison to a more healthful location
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
on some large tract of land on which buildings may be
erected largely by convict labor, and where the inmates may
in the future be employed in producing their own sustenance
thus saving a large part of the expense of the maintenance
of the prison.</p>

<h2>FORTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MANAGERS
OF THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY WORKHOUSE,
1910.</h2>

<p>This is one of the two or three penal institutions of the
State of Pennsylvania to which a farm is attached. The
Allegheny County Workhouse has, during the last year, added
175 acres to its holdings of real estate, at a cost of over
$288.00 per acre, and the total acreage now belonging to the
institution is about 280 acres. The total number of prisoners at
the close of last year was 863, an increase of 70 over the number
at the close of the year 1909. The daily average of inmates
was 824. During the year 1910 there were received at
the workhouse 3,836 male prisoners and 606 female prisoners.
The entire number was 4,442, of whom 3,606 were from Allegheny
County, and 836 were sent from other counties. For
the maintenance of prisoners outside of Allegheny County,
the institution received $23,396.</p>

<p>Of the 4,442 committed, there were committed for the
first time 2,301. One hundred and five had been committed
seven times. One hundred and fifteen had been committed
twenty times or oftener. Twelve prisoners were serving sentences
for the fiftieth time or more. It is not a place for
juvenile offenders. Of the whole number, 227 only were
under twenty years of age. The greater part of them are
between twenty and forty years of age. Only 630 could
neither read nor write, of which number 438 were foreign
born. Austria furnished the largest proportion of illiterates.</p>

<h3>HABITS OF LIFE.</h3>

<p>Four hundred and eighteen of these prisoners professed
to be total abstainers from intoxicants, and 540 are classified
as intemperate; 3,484 are occasionally intemperate or are
moderate drinkers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>Thirty-seven hundred and forty-seven prisoners weighed
at the time they were discharged 14,796 pounds more than
when they commenced to serve sentence, or an average of
three and ninth-tenth pounds increase for each individual.
Six hundred and twenty-five women prisoners showed an increase
of one and four-fifth pounds per individual.</p>

<p>Superintendent Leslie reports that the new wing is almost
completed. It will contain 478 reinforced concrete cells,
in four floors of about 120 cells each. At the back of the cells
is a five-foot utility corridor, in which all plumbing, waste
pipes and foul-air ducts are placed. Five feet in front of the
rows of the cells is a steel proof cage, extending the full length
of the rows. Between these cages and the outside wall is a
corridor which is lighted by large tool proof, obscure wire-glass
windows. The building is equipped with the best sanitary
appliances. The entire cost will be about $210,000.00,
which includes dynamos, engines and power plant of sufficient
capacity for another building of similar size. The larger part
of the work was done by the prisoners. During this last year
the total days’ work performed by the inmates on the new
building was 18,821.</p>

<p>But work on the new building is not by any means the
sole industrial employment. The total number of days’ work
of inmates is reported as 171,952. The industries comprise
broom and brush making, carpet weaving, farming operations,
wall building and domestic employments.</p>

<p>The revenue from brooms is estimated at $16,935.00;
brushes, $2,062.00, carpets, $4,610.00; boarding prisoners,
$31,620.00; farm products, $2,677.00.</p>

<p>The farm products of which the greater part was consumed
on the premises include 5,865 bushels potatoes, 1,550
bushels wheat, 424 bushels sweet corn, 1,058 bushels green
beans, 1,313 bushels tomatoes, 30,025 heads cabbage, 8,000
heads celery, 1,252 pounds butter, 3,039 gallons milk, 200
chickens, 496 dozen eggs. The total number of days’ employment
outside the walls was 28,857, and yet but one prisoner
made his escape.</p>

<p>Chaplain Imbrie reports that there is a Sabbath service
in the prison chapel, at which attendance is voluntary. “But
few absent themselves from this service.” They have a choir
of their own, with an efficient musical director. During the
winter there are frequent entertainments held in the chapel,
consisting of lectures, elocution and music. They have a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
judiciously selected library of 6,000 volumes, and the number
of books taken out during the year was 18,167.</p>

<p>They have a total enrollment in the night school of 185,
with an average attendance of about 176. This school is maintained
largely for the benefit of the illiterates and of those
whose education has been extremely limited. The difficulties
of presenting statistics of those who are permanently reformed
is well illustrated by the following extract from the chaplain’s
report: “As the year closes I find myself looking back and
counting the meetings and partings with more than four thousand
souls, who have come and gone during the past twelve
months.... I have known each one for a few weeks or
months, then they have gone like the ships that pass in the
night.... A few have written kind letters to me after having
reached their homes, a few have sent messages, ... some
I have met on the streets of the city, and a few have been
returned as prisoners to this institution, but the greater number
have been absorbed in the great mass of humanity, and
I have no further trace of them. The promises made at parting
may be broken, the influence of the few weeks spent here
may soon be effaced by the environments of the world, the seed
sown in the gospel messages may never mature, but yet the
effort has been made, and the increase is with the Father.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mt. Lebanon Prison, Syria.</span></p>

<p>... This prison is located in Bate-id-deen, where the
governor-general and all the government officials reside.
There I had an interesting call on the governor of Mt. Lebanon,
Yusuf Pasha Kusa.</p>

<p>I found him a very fine, polished gentleman, promising
that he will help to put a check on the drinking habit of his
country, and he gave me the privilege of visiting the prison and
meeting all the prisoners. It was a great opportunity after the
iron bars were opened and the kind-hearted warden let me in.
The prisoners gathered around me in great curiosity, as they
had never seen a woman in the court before. There were two
hundred and seventy-five (275) men prisoners. There were
Arabs, Druzes, Christians of all sects. The prison is a round
building with dark rooms around and an open court in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
center&mdash;four or five in every room. They are required to
furnish their own beds, clothing and food, except they receive
a portion of bread (about one and one half pounds) each day.
They gathered around me and were very eager to hear what
I had to say. For an hour and three quarters they listened
very attentively, and at last they showed their appreciation
by promising to live better lives. At the close of my speech
one of the prisoners asked the privilege of speaking, which
was granted. He said: “We want our friend to know that
not every one of us is a criminal, some of us are here through
lack of justice. If we were in a Christian country, under
Christian and just laws, many of us would not be here.”</p>

<p>The poor prisoners who had no friends to supply them
with any food have been living on bread and water, and I
was allowed the privilege of providing half of a sheep. They
were very grateful for it.</p>

<p>This will show you how prisoners live in a non-Christian
country. Then I thanked the Lord for the Pennsylvania
Prison Society, that is bettering the lives of the prisoners.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Humane Officials.</span></h3>

<p>A few days ago I went to your city to secure the release
from Central Police Station of a young lady about twenty-one
years of age, who had been in Philadelphia but a few months.
She had been accused by her employer of stealing. Whether
so or not, the judge, Hon. David S. Scott, and the officials
did not seem to believe it. That very efficient officer of the
Pennsylvania Prison Society, Mr. Fred J. Pooley, telegraphed
her brother in this county to send some one to Philadelphia
to look after her interests. I went and found that Judge Scott
had the right idea of treating uncertain cases of first offenders.
He told me that he always gives the prisoner the benefit of
doubt, and so metes out justice that supposed offenders might
have a chance to reform, if guilty, and not be made hard-hearted
criminals. In this case he turned the young lady over
to me, and I took her to her home, where a heartbroken father
and mother awaited her.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate your city upon having such just and
humane officials as Judge Scott, Reserve Officer Runner,
Matron Cooper&mdash;the right woman in the right place&mdash;and
Mr. Pooley is moving in the right direction in helping to save
accused criminals. His is a great work, and no better man
could be found for the position.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Striking Contrast.</span></h3>

<p>Westmoreland County is one of the prosperous and
wealthy counties of Pennsylvania. An evidence of its ability to
spend money for public improvements is its splendid courthouse.
This cost a million and a half. It is a magnificent
structure, rich in its art work and furnishings, and spotlessly
clean. Few county officers in the United States are more
comfortable and luxuriously housed.</p>

<p>Within a block or two of this fine pile stands another
county building. It is the jail. What a contrast! Here,
too, human beings are found, not, however, for a few hours
of the day, but by day and by night, for weeks and months
and years. But was there no thought for their physical well-being
when this jail was built? Is there none now for their
bodily and spiritual health? Not only is this jail an example
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
of an altogether faulty type of prison construction, but as at
present conducted it is unclean, and therefore unsanitary; it
is shamefully overcrowded; young and old, first offenders
and hardened criminals, are allowed to congregate indiscriminately
in the corridors; no attempt at classification or
reformation is apparent, and thus the history of many another
county jail is repeated in the midst of a community that by
reason of its Christian character, intelligence, and wealth
ought to be among the first in penal reform.</p>

<p>It is still true that many county jails are a blot&mdash;a very
dark blot on our civilization. When will reform begin where
it ought to begin, namely, at the bottom of our penal system?</p>

<h2 id="COUNTRY_LIFE_FOR_CONVICTS">COUNTRY LIFE FOR CONVICTS.</h2>

<p>For some years this subject has claimed much attention,
and latterly on account of the successful issue of experiments
in this direction, the reforming possibilities of such methods
have been prominently brought into notice. Hence we have
felt justified in devoting considerable space in this number to
this topic. It is appropriate that the citizens of Pennsylvania
particularly should have their attention called to the out-door
life for misdemeanants, since the Managers of the Western
Penitentiary have decided and have been permitted to remove
that institution to some large tract of ground within the State.</p>

<p>The two following articles are from “The Review,” published
by the National Prisoners’ Aid Association, 135 E.
15th St., New York City.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Farm Treatment of Misdemeanants.</span><br />

<span class="medium smcap">James F. Jackson.</span><br />

<small>Superintendent of Charities and Correction, Cleveland, Ohio.</small></h3>

<p>The old type institution for misdemeanants failed to accomplish
satisfactory results, mental, moral and physical. It
seemed incapable of developing industry; it was unhygienic,
without classification and with no adequate facilities for developing
a man’s will or increasing his capacity to do right.
There was no individualism. The old workhouse was typical
of the most intensified institutionalism, and institutionalism
for an adult is an assured failure. Neither the arrangements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
of the building nor the manner of life nor the administration
were conducive to the rehabilitation of the man. The old type
of workhouse was constructed to avenge the wrong and not
to correct the wrong-doer.</p>

<p>When the failure of that plan was fully recognized, people
cast about for a remedy. They saw the success and satisfaction
attending the location of charitable institutions in the
country, and the idea of similar locations for various types
of prisons occurred to them. And the cry against prison-made
goods gave impetus to the movement.</p>

<p>The prison did seem to be the last place to make real
the fact that “a man’s a man for a’ that.” But when the
plowshare and the pruning hook began to supplant the stripes
and the dungeon, people were certain that at last the dignity
of manhood would be realized and that life and immortality
were come to light.</p>

<p>St. Paul and Minneapolis were among the first to adopt
the farm policy. Various other corrective institutions were
established upon farms in foreign countries and in this country,
especially within the past twenty years. One of the best institutions
for misdemeanants thus established was located at
Witzwyl, Switzerland, in 1891. But I wish to-day to speak
with particular reference to Cleveland’s situation, its old workhouse
and its new correction farm.</p>

<p>The Cleveland workhouse was constructed over forty
years ago on the old lines for 500 prisoners, two miles from
the center of the city. In 1904 and 1905, about 750 acres
were purchased by the city nine miles from its center. Upon
this land building was commenced several years later. Thus
far there is built only the “service building” which at present
fulfills all purposes. Ultimately it is to be used for store-rooms
and shops. There are also to be built dormitories for
trusties and semi-trusties, cell-blocks for the least tractable,
kitchens, dining rooms, a chapel, women’s industrial building,
school building and a greenhouse, all within a high wall inclosing
eleven acres. The present intention is that the buildings
and wall shall be constructed by the labor of inmates.
Unfortunately there are no funds in sight to proceed with this
construction.</p>

<p>All commitments are made to the original workhouse
in the city. There the women remain, but about two fifths
of the men are transferred to the correction farm. On a recent
day the 102 men at the correction farm were assigned to work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
as follows: On construction of the sewage disposal plant, 24;
in the stone quarry, 7; on the farm, 10; in the garden, 7;
driving teams (working the farm and hauling material to the
filter bed), 12; care of horses and stock, 10; to work on the
adjoining infirmary farm, 10; firemen, 2; carpenter, 1;
barber, 1; and in the preparation and serving of the meals
and care of the buildings and grounds, 18. Some of these last
eighteen are unable to do heavy work, but all have fresh air
and sunshine daily. At other times men do concreting, making
artificial stone, fertilize and drain the land, which is not
fertile, make roads on the farm and later they will construct
the wall and buildings, plant trees and perform every sort of
labor that will develop the land, and cause it to be highly
productive and attractive in appearance. I also hope that
later they will make and repair the needed wagons, tools and
all the smaller farm implements; in fact, they now do some
of that work, especially the repairing.</p>

<p>An apple orchard and much small fruit have just been
planted under the direction of the state agricultural department.
Last year by attention to pruning, spraying and smudge
fires on cold nights, ours was one of the few orchards bearing
fruit in all that region. Bee culture will be introduced and
scientific forestration is to be developed. We are about to construct
a dairy barn entirely by prison labor that will be a
model of simplicity, sanitary construction and efficiency for
the neighboring country.</p>

<p>We propose that the farm shall gradually become a model
in all respects. In fact, this year we will produce certified
milk for the city and the contagious disease hospitals. We
plan, as soon as possible, that the correction farm shall produce
the meat, milk, vegetables and fruit, both fresh and
canned, for the entire workhouse and the public hospitals,
while the adjoining infirmary farm will render similar service
for its own use and that of the growing tuberculosis sanatorium.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the prisoner, the farm policy is
to give to each man the largest degree of liberty consistent
with the well-being of others. The ultimate purpose is to employ
as many without the walls as possibly can be trusted,
and to employ out-of-doors within the walls all the remainder
except those whose conduct imperatively demands closest
supervision.</p>

<p>For years there will be work for all workers, no “idle-house”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
in any sort of weather or trade conditions. Every
working day from twelve to twenty men are sent to work
on the adjoining infirmary farm. Such transfer was one of
the purposes of placing the infirmary on a great contiguous
tract of land. But the plan works to the detriment of the correction
farm, which for years, and perhaps always, can use
to advantage the labor of all men committed to its care. No
key is turned on these men during the day. The night guard
and the locked door are more to remove temptation than to
prevent escape. You realize this when you know that all these
men, instead of sleeping in stuffy cells, sleep in large dormitories,
giving them every facility for overpowering the night
watch and making their escape. Prisoners arrive a typical
bridewell company, drunken, dirty, diseased and discouraged.
They go away bronzed, with regular habits of living, accustomed
to work, with a new determination and a new grip. Of
course, some fail and return, but we do not assume to insure
immunity against all the wiles of the world, the flesh and
the devil.</p>

<p>Americans seem in constant search for a cure-all. There
is a great demand for some hobby for the alert philanthropist
to ride. In their order institutionalism, organized charity,
juvenile courts, medical charities and country life have had
their turn in the spotlight. Each is efficient, but all together
are not sufficient. It is urged that if a convict be sent out
under the blue sky to breathe God’s pure air, behold green
fields and hear the birds sing from the swaying boughs, he
will become as one of the best citizens, especially if he digs in
the dirt. But unfortunately the country does not afford the
alchemy which converts men into angels. This is amply attested
by the record of most diabolical crimes committed by
country-bred men who would not know an elevator from a
subway. The farm prison is no panacea, but it is tremendously
worth while.</p>

<p>The men do not wear stripes in either prison. Consideration
is combined with firmness in all our dealings, for it is the
purpose that every requirement shall appeal to the fair-minded
prisoner to be in his interest and for his benefit.</p>

<p>From the experience of the Cleveland correction farm
several rather obvious deductions may be made; we are dealing
with men, free moral agents, and a good physical environment
does not guarantee their reform any more than does instruction
in good rules for living.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>We have learned that men are sent to the house of correction
for a purpose. These men have faults to be corrected.
These defects in the human mind are to be corrected, and no
ordinary workhouse sentence will effect a cure of such defects
as are hereditary or fully acquired. There is some concealed
materialism abroad under the guise of environment, but the
rankest exponent of environment should not expect to cure
twenty years of bad surroundings accompanied by indifferent
or bad actions even by a ninety-day period on a farm. And
ninety days is in excess of the average period of confinement,
although Cleveland “golden-rule policies” do not burden us
with five-, ten- or fifteen-day men.</p>

<p>Our first appeal is to their sense of honor. Their appreciation
of the confidence reposed in them often proves a potent
influence for good. The transfer to the farm is such an expression
of confidence. But it is given with discretion. Hardened
criminals are not sent on distant missions unattended.
In fact, they are rarely transferred to the farm.</p>

<p>As a part of their teaching the misdemeanants need discipline.
It is necessary to keep the men on the farm for
some time if they are to receive the needed development, especially
the men who are sent for intoxication. Discipline is
essential to instruction whether in the day school, the home
or any other form of education. Many of these men are committed
because of their lack of self-control and time is required
for its development. We have learned that the men
need to be taught the habit of industry and how to do some
particular thing well. This is for their good while they are
on the farm, and it is essential after they return to their
homes. We have learned that not all men can be trusted, and
we believe it has a bad influence on a man to attempt to get
away, so we make him feel the bad result when he is caught.
And the police are faithful to help catch deserters. Personality
is a big factor; one man will accomplish far more with
and for prisoners than another.</p>

<p>The farm does build up the body of the anæmic; it gives
a good physical development. Moreover, the habit of industry
can very much better be taught where results are being
achieved on the farm than where work is being done at little
or no profit in a factory. And efficiency is better developed
on the farm. The farm has a direct physical value and an
indirect mental and moral value. It clears a man’s mind and
allows him to think straight. It affords a foundation for developing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the spiritual structure, though of itself it will only
slightly develop one mentally or morally. The man is now
physically well, having had lessons in life. Here is the opportunity
to further develop his will in order that he may do
right. Looking to that end, we have introduced the regular
presentation of the gospel in an orderly way. We intend to
teach by example, but we need an official who shall be recognized
by the prisoners as their friend, one who shall know
them and make it his exclusive business to help them establish
the desire to do right and aid them to be able to fulfill that
desire. This seems one of the unsolved problems in Cleveland
and in nearly all such institutions.</p>

<p>We have the parole system in operation, though there is
not help enough for its most efficient execution. There is the
Brotherhood Club for the men who have no home to which
to go, established at the suggestion of a former prisoner.
There a man may stay until he appears strong enough to live
a normal life. The club is intended to be self-sustaining.</p>

<p>In my opinion the country is the place for the misdemeanant,
for the very obvious reason that it affords plenty
of light, pure air, a variety of good food and wide opportunity
for productive occupation for the prisoners. There work
is purposeful, not a time-killer. They work, eat, sleep, have
recreation and religious teaching, all under approximately
normal conditions. Every man is treated with kindness and
consideration; discipline is not on parade. In short, the
prisoner is treated like a man and to the extent that if there is
manhood in him it will come out. The purpose is to develop
honor and faithfulness, to accustom every man to useful
occupation and to teach him to be effective. The officers
are not armed, they are not even called guards. In fact, they
act as teachers, foremen or farmers, as the occasion requires.</p>

<p>There is so much work to do in developing, enriching
and cultivating the land, in erecting buildings, in making roads,
that every feasible labor-saving machine is used. This of itself
speaks to the man the appreciation of his work as a man and
not a substitute for a machine.</p>

<p>The hope is that the farming and the making of its
equipment, and incidentally the care of the prisoners and their
quarters, will profitably occupy practically all the available
labor in such manner as to make a man not only fit but anxious
to work. It is hoped that a large majority will be improved
and many rehabilitated in an environment which favors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
giving every man all the chance he will use to reform. Moreover,
it will thereby be apparent that the government is not
only strong, but so merciful and so genuine in its fatherly
desire to help each man that in turn he will cease to be “agin”
the government; that he will turn from being a consumer to
become a producer of taxes, turn from being his own and
other’s enemy to become a friend to men.</p>

<span class="small smcap">Warden J. T. Gilmour, Central Prison, Ontario, Canada.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>[Stenographic report of Dr. Gilmour’s address at the annual meeting
of the New Jersey State Charities Aid and Prison Reform Association,
April 1, 1911.]</p></blockquote>

<p>When we speak of criminals we are very apt to picture
in our mind’s eye the great criminals, those who commit
atrocious crimes. But that class forms but a very small percentage
of every prison population, and the methods of dealing
with this class are much more clear and definite than dealing
with the much larger class that are not quite so dangerous
to society. When we speak of criminals we are apt to think
of them <i>en masse</i> as a congregation of a few hundred or a
few thousand men walled within a prison. Carlyle dissipates
this view when he says: “Masses? Yea, masses, every unit
of whom has his own heart and sorrows&mdash;stands there covered
with his own skin; and if you prick him he will bleed.”</p>

<p>In dealing with delinquency there are two basic facts:
that the great majority of criminals are made in their youth
and that the great majority of youthful criminals are handicapped
in life’s race either by physical, mental or moral defects.
That prince of sociologists, Victor Hugo, evidently
appreciated these conditions when he gave us that beautiful
injunction to study evil lovingly, and then, later on, he gave
the key when he said: “There are no bad weeds. They are
only bad cultivators.”</p>

<p>Two or three weeks ago a young man came into the corridor
of our prison one day and asked, “Warden, will you
take me out to the farm,” (A prison farm, of which I hope
to speak a little later.) I said, “No, Smith, I cannot take
you out.” Over in our country when we wish to conceal
a man’s identity we always call him Smith, and if we are particularly
careful we call him John Smith. This man was a
repeater; he was doing his fifth term; the four previous terms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
he had been a very difficult man to get along with, but this
time he had done very well. We could take no exception to
either his conduct or his industry. He said to me, “Have I
not done well this time?” I said “You certainly have.”
“Well, then,” he said, “won’t you give me a chance?” Of
course, he had me there; I couldn’t refuse him. I said, “Yes,
I’ll give you a chance.” I took him up to the farm on a
Monday; he worked well on Tuesday and on Wednesday;
and on Wednesday night he skipped. The following Friday
we got him again, in a town one hundred and fifty miles from
home, and I pitied the poor fellow when he came back, he
looked so dejected and so crestfallen; but I blamed myself
entirely. I had imposed a burden of self-denial and a responsibility
of conduct upon that man that he was not able to
bear. He was one of that class, typical of a considerable percentage
of our prison populations, that is on the borderland
between sanity and insanity; and all the prison officials who
are here to-night will recall scores of that class who form a
part of their prison population.</p>

<p>As I say, I had made a mistake with this boy; but it
only goes to show that penologists are not infallible, not even
the youngest of them. If we were to stop to speculate upon
the place that this element occupies in the divine scheme, we
might tread upon very dangerous ground. It is enough for
us to know that the God that made them is the God that will
judge them; and herein lies our consolation. I had a man
come into prison a few weeks ago to do two years, and yesterday
afternoon, just an hour before I left home for coming
down here, his wife came into my office leading a beautiful
child five years of age by the hand. She came, as so many
poor women come, to see if it were not possible to get some
relief from her almost intolerable position. As the cruel truth
dawned upon her that it was impossible for me to exercise
clemency in regard to her husband, the woman turned to me
and she said with much emphasis, “If they would only send
me and my child to prison, how much better it would have
been.”</p>

<p>And the woman expressed a great verity. This little
episode I relate to show you that society has two obligations:
one to the man shut up within the prison, and perhaps an even
greater obligation to the poor woman and children dependent
upon the man shut up within the prison. It is necessary to
lock up a certain class of men that society may be protected,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
and that these men may be improved; but when we do that
are we going to put their families in a position in which they
will be impelled into either vice or crime? I think it is Milton
who asks the pertinent question:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“What boots it, by one gate to make defense<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And at another to let in the foe?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In dealing with the wives and children, as well as with
the prison inmates over in our place, we find an immense help
from the Salvation Army. We have a prisoner’s aid association
and they work harmoniously together; but the Army
has one or two advantages in this work that no other organization
possesses. In the first place, they are not sentimentalists.
They detail one man to give his time to it. He is as free to
go into our prison as I am, and I think he spends as much
time there as I do. He is there at night, on Sundays, on
holidays, at noon hours, and he is going from cell to cell&mdash;he
becomes thoroughly acquainted with every inmate. That
gives that man an immense advantage in dealing with those
men when their terms expire. The prison worker that expects
to meet the discharged prisoner at the prison gate the morning
he comes out, is much more apt to be worked by the
prisoner than he is to work the prisoner. In three cases out
of five he is clay in the hands of a designing man. One of
our governors some years ago said that Canada was a land of
magnificent distances. The same remark applies to your republic;
but we get prisoners thirteen hundred miles from our
prison. The Army, learning the condition of the families dependent
on the man within the prison, writes to the corps, the
Salvation Army corps in the town or the city where the man
came from, and they are able by their very extensive and
highly perfected organization, to make a study of each family,
in addition to having arrangements made there for the employment
of that man when his term has expired. We try,
just as far as possible, to get all of our ex-prisoners out of
the city. We do not wish them to colonize; we try to get
them back to their homes where they came from, for unless a
man is willing to go back and face society and live it down,
the chances are that he will be driven into what is wrong
sometimes through fear.</p>

<p>A year ago now we started our farm. It is fifty miles
out of the city; it contains 530 acres. I commenced by taking
up a little detachment of 14 men, and I rapidly increased that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
until I had 180 men, housed in temporary quarters on this
farm. The average term of the man on the farm was about
five or six months, though I had several men there who had
to do from one to two years. So far we have taken out to
this farm 500 men, and out of that 500, 4 have escaped successfully
and 3 or 4 have attempted to escape&mdash;unsuccessfully.
The other day a minister in our city was calling and I gave
him these statistics, and he looked very sad; he said it was a
pity. I said it was; “but,” I said, “can you take 500 of your
church membership and have 495 of them make good?” And
he changed the subject.</p>

<p>I had a grand jury visit me the other day; it is a custom
over in our country for the grand juries to come over a few
times a year and tell us how to run the place (they sometimes
stay an hour), and the foreman, before he went away,
said to me, “Warden, I suppose you select the men whom
you take out to the farm.” I said, “No, sir, I don’t.” He
said, “How do you manage?” I said, “I select a very few
whom I <i>don’t</i> take;” for I can take 90 per cent. About
three weeks ago I was going into the farm one day, it was
a cold, snowy, blowing, blustering day; the thermometer was
about zero. When I came near to our building it was quarter
to twelve o’clock, and I saw men coming from this direction
and that direction, and from every direction pass alone; no
officers with them at all, and it impressed me, perhaps, much
more than it would another one not engaged in this work, for
I asked myself the question, “How is it? These are the very
men that I have had in Toronto behind bolts and bars, watched
over by guns and guards, and here they are out here as free
as this air that blows, and they are all coming in to sit down
with each other at dinner.” I have asked our men on the
farm&mdash;many of them different types, at different places, at
different times&mdash;and I have asked them all the same question.
“What do you find the greatest difference as between the
prison in the city and the prison out here on the farm?” And
without a single exception, in one form or another, those men
have invariably given me the same reply. We give good
board at the prison, but it was not that; it was not this liberty,
comparative liberty. They have said to me: “Warden, to get
away from that cell! To get away from that cell!”</p>

<p>I asked a boy two weeks ago, a young man, and he said,
“Warden, to get away from that cell; for,” he said, “to sit
there on Sunday, every evening and on holidays and have that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
cell gate staring you in the face, it is hell;” and he didn’t say
it to be irreverent or disrespectful, but it was his pent-up emotions.
I believe there is something debasing&mdash;debasing to a
man’s personal manhood&mdash;about life in a cell that no one can
describe. Our men plow, they harrow, they sow the grain,
they reap it; there is no guard with them at all. Of course,
these are men who are near the end of their terms, perhaps
men who have three months or less to do; but every prison
contains enough of that class to enable them to carry on this
class of work, agricultural work, to a financial advantage. If
we had to pay guard to be with these various men we couldn’t
do it, but we don’t. There is an indefinable something in
God’s out-of-doors that has a beneficial effect upon humanity.
I cannot tell you what it is. “The wind bloweth where it
listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but thou canst
not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth. So is every
man that is born of the spirit.”</p>

<p>A few months ago a professor from the University of
Kansas wrote a little poem of two or three verses, and one
of the verses reads like this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A breeze on the far horizon,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The infinite tender sky&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The ripe, rich tint of the corn fields<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And the wild geese sailing high;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all over upland and lowland<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The charm of the goldenrod:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Some of us call it autumn<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And others call it God.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Do you catch the spirit of those beautiful lines? They
tell (what I should like to tell were I able) of the way God
speaks to our delinquents out on the farm through the hazy
atmosphere and the golden sunsets; they tell of the way God
speaks to those poor fellows through the growing and the
ripening grains, and of the message that God sends to them
through the birds that sing and soar over their heads. It suggests
that beautiful thought of Browning’s:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“This world, as God has made it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Always glitters. And knowing this is love,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And love is duty.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are aiming at something definite in the construction
of our new prison. We are going to try to give that large
class of boys and young men that come to prison for the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
time, one more opportunity of going through life without being
immured in a prison cell. In the construction of our
buildings our domicile accommodations will be largely of the
dormitory type&mdash;small dormitories, accommodating fourteen
beds, with a large, semicircular bay window on one side which
will serve as a sitting room, attached to which dormitory will
be a completely equipped bedroom and dressing room. The
corridor, which runs along the side where the officers will
patrol, is divided from these rooms that I speak of by a glass
partition, so that our men are thoroughly under observation
every hour of the day and night, and there will be no opportunities
whatever for some of those things that penologists
so much dread. In addition to that, we have a number of
single rooms and a number of cells, but in a prison which is
destined to accommodate 600, we are only putting in 40 cells.
The men who behave and who demonstrate that they can appreciate
that dormitory life and maintain the condition of it,
we hope to give ultimately a single room, and the men who
fail to appreciate this dormitory life and don’t behave as we
wish them to, will then be demoted into a cell; but we are
going to try, as I say, to get those boys through life, if possible,
without the cell. Will we succeed? I don’t know. I
don’t know. We have our critics, but this world will never
be saved by the critics; it will be saved by the dreamers. The
history of humanity is the history of indomitable hope. Emerson
says that “Every thing is free to the man that can grasp
it;” that “He who despairs is wrong.”</p>

<p>In dealing with delinquents, it is the personal touch that
tells. Human nature craves for sympathy. Kingsley was
once asked what the secret of his joyous, buoyant life was,
and his ready reply was, “I had a friend.” Our Saviour was
no exception to this rule, for as our Saviour approached Gethsemane,
he yearned for a friend whom he could rely upon to
wait and watch while he endured, and expressed it in that
pathetic request to the drowsy Peter and his sleepy comrades.
When we see a very simple duty staring us in the face in dealing
with this class, we are too prone to say: “Lord, here am
I. Send him.” It is an easy matter for a man of means to
write his check, or give his cash, but it is an entirely different
thing to carry that gift to some poor fellow who is down and
out and sweeten it with the fragrance of personal kindness.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Not what we give, but what we share;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The gift without the giver is bare.”<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
</div></div>

<p>We have church service at our place every Sunday afternoon
and Wednesday afternoon. One day our preacher failed
to materialize; the men were in the chapel and I did not wish
to have them return to the cells without saying something
to them; as I could not preach, I thought I would do the next
best thing, and I would read another fellow’s sermon, only I
gave the other fellow credit for it. I was reading a book
just then that interested me very much, and I went down to
the office and got it and I read the first chapter, and when I
finished I asked if I should read more, and they said, “Yes,
Warden.” I read a second and a third chapter; I read as
long as my voice would hold out; and as I had finished a
man down in the audience said, “Won’t you be kind enough
to tell me the name of that book and the author?” I was
very glad to have them ask the question; I told him. The
next morning when I was going through the prison industries,
the officers kept asking me what book I read the previous
day. I said, “Why do you ask?” They said, “The men are
all talking about it.” I sent down town and got fifteen copies
and sent them around among the cells, with instructions that
no one man could keep it for more than a week. When we
collected the books at the end of the first week I found that
a great many men had taken paper and copied out portions
of it. This was practically a non-reading population. They
had refused a lot of good books we had put in our library
which I had thought were fine, much to my disappointment.
Perhaps you would like to know the kind of book they so
much enjoyed, and, with your permission, I will just read
you the first page of the first chapter.</p>

<p>“Man has two Creators: his God and himself. The first
creator furnishes him the raw material of his life and the laws
of conformity with which he can make that life what he will.
His second creator, himself, has marvelous powers he rarely
realizes. It is what a man makes of himself that counts. If
a man fails in life he usually says, I am as God made me.
When he succeeds in life he proudly proclaims himself a self-made
man. Man is placed into this world, not as a finality,
but as a possibility. Man’s greatest enemy is himself. Man
in his weakness is the creature of circumstances; man in his
strength is the creator of circumstances. Whether he be
victim or victor depends largely on himself. Man is never
truly great, merely for what he is, but ever for what he may
become.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>Now that is pretty good meat. And that afternoon I
was the one who learned the great lesson, for I learned that
if we approach this subject in the right way we can waken,
even in dormant minds, a desire for good literature. And my
little experience of the afternoon revolutionized my method
of dealing with the boys in this respect.</p>

<p>Dr. Jordan, of Boston, is the author of that book, and
it is called “Self-Control.” Briefly and hurriedly I have just
tried to sketch some of the phases in dealing with delinquency.
Who are they for whom we should do these things? What
claim have they upon us? What is our relationship to them?
Did you ever hear the story of the Scotch girl, the one who
was carrying a crippled boy over a street crossing in Edinburgh?
A gentleman, seeing her burden, hastened up to
assist and sympathize with her, and the girl looked up smiling
and replied: “Ah, sir, I dinna mind it. He is my brither!”</p>

<h2 id="FARMING_FOR_EX-CRIMINALS">FARMING FOR EX-CRIMINALS.</h2>

<p>According to Salvation Army officials of England, there
is something about farming which alters the criminal mind.
Just what it is they do not profess to know, but they do know
from experience that tilling the soil makes a better man of
the ex-convict. Land-owners in the suburbs of London have
become interested and have sold the Army numbers of small
tracts. These tracts, in turn, are rented on easy terms to released
prisoners with an arrangement by which the latter are
further enabled to buy them outright. Thus far nine hundred
men who have worn the stripes have been bettered in this
way. So successful, in fact, has the scheme proved that the
people of London are actually beginning to see in these farmers
a means of supplying a deficient vegetable market&mdash;for
London, like American cities, is suffering to an extent from
the high cost of living.</p>

<p>There is room aplenty in America for farm colonies of
ex-convicts. Considering the results obtained in England,
the scheme would seem worthy of experiment on a scale sufficient
to prove its merit or demerit.

<h2 id="THE_OMAHA_MEETING_OF_THE_AMERICAN">THE OMAHA MEETING OF THE AMERICAN
PRISON ASSOCIATION.<br />

<span class="medium smcap">Report of the Delegate.</span></h2>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Omaha, Neb.</span>, October 20, 1911.<br />
</p>

<p>If the delegates to the American Prison Association are
to form a judgment of the people of Omaha from the cordial
reception they have met in this large western city, the conclusion
may easily be reached that these people are most
generous, hospitable and appreciative.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the Association was held in the
Auditorium connected with the Hotel Rome. The number of
delegates which had registered on the first day of the meeting
was about 300. The Auditorium will seat several hundred
and was almost filled by the delegates and citizens of
Omaha, who appeared to be deeply interested in the proceedings.</p>

<p>Before us on a platform banked up with roses and carnations
and draped above with the American Flag, sat the President,
T. B. Patton, of Pennsylvania, and other officers of the
Association; Governor Aldrich of the State of Nebraska,
Mayor Dahlman of Omaha, and other eminent citizens.</p>

<p>Judge Lee Estelle, Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements,
presided over this meeting. I understand that
he came from a hospital, really a very sick man, to discharge
a duty which he had previously agreed to perform. After a
few brief words in which he referred to the badge adopted
for the members on this occasion, which consists of a small
gilt key with the usual ribbon attachment, he assured us that
this key indicated an entrance into all the homes of Omaha
and informed us that all the doors were not only open but
really off their hinges for us. He introduced Governor Aldrich
who then made the main welcoming speech.</p>

<p>He dwelt upon the material advantages of the State of
Nebraska, presenting many statistics to indicate the vastness
of the resources of this large state. Many of his contrasts
were quite humorous. In figures he mentioned the value of
the manufactured products of the State for 1910 and compared
the amount with the value of the oil produced in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
same year in the entire United States, showing a difference
in favor of the State of Nebraska on these two accounts of
more than $37,000,000. He also showed that the value of
beef produced in the State exceeded by $2,000,000 the value
of tobacco products in the United States for 1910. He told us
that four thousand students were in attendance at their University,
ninety per cent. of whom came from the State of
Nebraska.</p>

<p>Mayor Dahlman followed with a kindly speech.</p>

<p>President Patton then delivered his annual address. If
I may select any key note of his remarks, it would be to the
effect that all of our prison officials should be selected, not
only for the ability to govern and restrain, but more especially
for the ability to influence and to build up the characters of
those who are under them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The enactment of such wise legislation as is best calculated to properly
protect society and to provide, under humane discipline and restraint,
an adequate punishment for the offender; the securing of the proper and
regular employment of the prisoner in prison under wise state law; the
obtaining of a rightful portion of the prisoner’s earnings for the use
of his dependent family; the systematic investigation of their real needs
and the furnishing of prompt relief to the worthy and possible effort
for their rehabilitation or removal to more favorable surroundings; the
invoking of the probation law where such will be conducive to the best
results; the comprehensive study of the prison population as far as possible
to secure proper statistics on which to base accurate results; the
well organized effort now at work in a number of our larger centers of
population, in the study and betterment of the slum districts and the more
general effort in many localities in the interest of the betterment of the
environment of the children and youth, are all encouraging signs of the
far-reaching interest at work for the uplift and saving of humanity, and
to this end we say, Godspeed to the organizations which in carrying forward
their work, have gone back to the childhood days, and which, striving
to break the bondage, not only of heredity and environment, are,
through sympathy, love and interest thus securing a foothold in districts,
communities and individual homes as well, and in which their organized
effort is bearing a fruitage most encouraging, indeed and bids fair in
due course of time to prove a strong bulwark in the reduction of crime,
as well as of the criminal class.”</p></blockquote>

<p>He referred with feeling to the deaths of Gen. Brinkerhoff
and John J. Lytle, referring to the latter as an Apostle
of Peace and Good Cheer. He then introduced Dr. Charles
Richmond Henderson, of Chicago, who spoke with his usual
energy and earnestness. He would do away with municipal and
county jails, except as they may be necessary as places of temporary
detention. They are run on such a small scale, he
said, that the men in charge cannot have the training nor
facilities that should be present in the reformation of criminals.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
He would have the criminals turned over to the state
for punishment and reformation as soon as they are convicted
by the county or municipal courts. Dr. Henderson emphasized
the desirability of classifying wrongdoers and declared that
the stamp of criminality should not be placed upon men who
are not in spirit criminals. He pleaded especially for more
humane treatment of habitual drunkards. “Can you cure a
drunkard by giving him ten days in jail, in an atmosphere
of degradation and crime, when the habit is to him a thing of
generations?”</p>

<p>He commended the system recently adopted in the District
of Columbia under which inebriates are sent to an institution
in the country, where they are allowed to work in
the open air under wholesome environment and are not branded
as of the criminal class. “Sooner or later the student of
criminology must come to a realization of the importance of
the study of the child.” Heredity was mentioned as a factor
in the problem, and the subject of early environment should
receive careful study.</p>

<p>He congratulated the Association for their good work
in advocating the adoption of laws providing for the Indeterminate
Sentence. This does not mean that a man must
always be discharged before the time of his maximum sentence,
it may also mean the creation of tribunals to decide
whether a man is ready to be let loose upon society regardless
of the time of his sentence. In other words, our prisons and
reformatories should be conducted as hospitals and as institutions
for those whose minds are diseased, from which patients
are discharged upon recovery of their malady.</p>

<h3>THE BIG MEETING.</h3>

<p>The interest of the citizens of Omaha was displayed in
their attendance at the mass meeting held on Sabbath afternoon
in the Auditorium of the city. This building has accommodations
for several thousand, and was nearly filled.
This meeting was addressed by Professor Henderson, Warden
Gilmour of Toronto, Canada, Bishop Tihen of the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, Neb., and Maud Ballington
Booth. It is not my intention in this communication to present
to you even a synopsis of what was said on this great
occasion, but such meetings arouse interest in our cause to
many whom our published reports never reach.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>Professor Henderson condemned the changes of officials
in our prisons on account of political conditions. He condemned
the construction of iron cells for prisoners, saying
that it was absurd that in the construction of prisons some
dealer in structural iron should impose upon the officials a
building more suitable for the caging of animals in a zoölogical
garden.</p>

<p>Warden Gilmour of Toronto, Canada, emphasized the importance
of fresh air and sunshine as a reformatory agency.
“If we can take our prisoners from the jails and the workhouses
and build them up physically, which we must do first
if we would build them up morally, we have made the first
great step toward reform.” He has a farm of 840 acres, to
which he has sent from 800 to 900 prisoners. Of them, he
has failed in the reform of 3 out of each 100, and has succeeded
in 97 out of every 100. The great majority of our
jail population does not consist of criminals, he said, but of
men who have been the victims of their environment. With
the proper environment, such as fresh air and sunshine, wholesome
work, kind treatment, trust reposed in them, and the
sympathy and help of men and women interested in their
welfare, they become useful members of society.</p>

<p>“The first man created, so divine history tells us, proved
a delinquent, and God’s sentence upon him was to go forth and
<i>till the soil</i>; can man to-day impose a better sentence upon
our delinquents?”</p>

<p>Bishop Tihen dwelt upon the importance of investigating
the causes of crime. “If you go down into the slums, and
find that the chief cause of crime is the unfit habitations, do
not condemn the habitations and stop there; find out the owner
of them who profits from the dollars received for their rent,
and denounce him. If you find the poor orphan girl working
in the big department store at wages at which you know she
cannot live upon, do not wait until you find her a few months
later when she has become a fallen woman through the necessity
to which hunger has driven her, and then try to reform
her; go at once to the proprietor and demand that she receive
living wages.”</p>

<p>Maud Ballington Booth electrified the great audience
with accounts of what had been accomplished by the Gospel
of Love and Hope. She told briefly of her work of taking
men from prisons and giving them a chance on the farms and
in the homes of our people. She finds positions for them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
when they can be recommended, and during the last fifteen
years she recalled that many thousands have been saved by
such treatment from going back to lives of crime. “It’s hope
that they need, and there’s hope for all of them; if there’s
hope for the millionaire, there’s hope for the burglar; if
there’s hope for the politician, there’s hope for the man behind
prison walls.”</p>

<h3>ANNUAL SERMON.</h3>

<p>The annual sermon was preached by Frank L. Loveland,
of Topeka, Kansas. His address was eminently practical. He
thought that prevention was better than rescue. The work
of the “Good Samaritan” was good, but it were far better
to extirpate the robbers. In these days the robbers are not
the wild Bedouins of the desert, but society which tolerates
conditions which bring forth a crop of criminals.</p>

<h3>PRISON DISCIPLINE.</h3>

<p>The report of the standing committee on Prison Discipline
was presented by Warden Scott of the New Hampshire
Prison, and was heard with great interest.</p>

<p>“Rules and regulations degrading in their character have
long since been found to be more a menace to our system of
prison discipline than otherwise. We have seen the downcast
eye, the striped suit, short hair cut, lockstep, the dark cell
and various forms of methods of corporal punishment replaced
by more humane, more sensible regulations, and venture
the assertion that in no prison in the country where this
has been done will one fail to find the standard of discipline
improved.</p>

<p>“When a man has been sentenced by the court to prison
at hard labor, and during his confinement is of good behavior,
he has the right to expect that no further punishment will be
inflicted upon him than that prescribed by the court.</p>

<p>“The knowledge that special privileges are not granted
to any prisoner that cannot be earned by every other is an
effective aid to discipline. So, also, is cleanliness of person,
clothing, bedding and cell essential to good conduct. Plenty
of well-cooked and well-balanced food should be provided, a
well-stocked library, a school for the illiterate, a new voice
in chaplain occasionally at divine service, lectures on interesting
subjects by prominent men, entertainments on holidays,
all these are good for the prisoner and good for the prison.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>The plan of grading prisoners, in operation in many
prisons, has undoubtedly brought about a more perfect system
of discipline and should be adopted in all prisons and reformatories,
large and small. It stimulates pride in most
prisoners.</p>

<p>Productive labor in prisons not only greatly aids discipline
and reformation, conserves the health of the prisoner
and fits him to be self-supporting when discharged, but secures
to the state relief from the cost of maintenance of the
prisoners.</p>

<p>The warden or superintendent should be clothed with
authority to appoint or remove the subordinate officers without
hindrance or dictation.</p>

<p>Warden James of Oregon told of the results obtained
through generous treatment of prisoners. “I find that the
more privileges we can extend consistent with good discipline,
the easier it is to obtain good discipline. Since we inaugurated
amusements such as moving-pictures, Saturday baseball and
other forms of exercise, reports of infractions of rules have
been reduced fifty per cent.” Warden Lewis of Michigan
said that he allowed outside teams to play against the prison
team. He thought the morale of the institution was improved
by such innovation. Warden Sanders, of Iowa, thought that
men would universally improve if we show that we have confidence
in them. Some time ago his friends were very solicitous
for his safety when he took a gang of eight convicts out to cut
corn. Each convict was supplied with a keen bladed corn-knife
and the cornfield was some miles from the prison. He
went with them without arms and though his friends feared
they would never see him alive, he accompanied them with no
thought of danger. Some of them were serving life sentences,
but they all returned in the evening, not having shown the
slightest indication of escaping or offering violence.</p>

<h3>FAMILIES OF PRISONERS.</h3>

<p>Judge DeLacy of the District of Columbia sent a communication
with regard to the dependent families of prisoners.
He informed the Association that such families are cared for
in two ways: one by direct appropriation from the public
funds and the other by a collection of the earnings of the
prisoners. In 1907 there was paid for this purpose from the
funds, $200.00; and from prisoners’ earnings, $6,050.00. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
1911 the public appropriation had reached $3,000.00; and
the amount dispensed from prisoners’ earnings, $38,684.00.</p>

<p>The eloquent earnestness of Maud Ballington Booth met
with sympathetic attention.</p>

<p>“Every man who works in prison should, after his own
board and clothing have been paid for, work for the support
of his family or for those depending upon him. Some
officials seem not to know that a convict may have a family,
yet there is always this heart-saddened, home-broken circle
of gloom, the mothers, wives and children of convicts, about
every penal institution. Wherewith are they to be fed and
clothed? What recognition does the state give to them from
whom it has taken their only source of support? I know of
one case where the state gets $500,000 a year from its convict
labor. The larger the number of convicts, the greater the
revenue. But what of the army of helpless and hopeless
wives and children who are being deprived of the support of
these laborers who are their husbands and fathers? The
helping hand extended to the family has a reflex action on
the man in prison. He realizes that his efforts are helping
those who have been, and are still, dependent on his services.”</p>

<h3>A SELF-SUPPORTING PRISON.</h3>

<p>Parole Officer Venn of Michigan presented some facts
of very great interest as determined from their experience in
the Detroit House of Correction. The plant, costing originally
$190,000, had paid for itself and $1,000,000 had been turned
over to the city, to the prisoners themselves and to their
families in the past thirty-two years. “In Michigan the contract
system is doomed, its expiring gasp having been determined
by legislative enactment. This system is held in disrepute,
especially among the ranks of free-toilers whether
organized or not. When the prisoner or his family, or the
state, receives the profit from prison labor, and not some contracting
firm, which pays to the state the paltry sum of from
thirty-five cents to seventy-five cents per diem for the toil of
its wards, the mouth of the objector is silenced.”</p>

<p>Mr. Venn said that very often the paroled man needed
some financial assistance, sometimes to purchase tools, or for
some very proper object, and that he had loaned to such men
within the last two years the sum of $860, of which sum
$630 had been refunded. He regarded most of the balance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
as an absolutely safe investment. The money which comes
back can be used for others in need, and the prisoner is not
treated as a pauper.</p>

<h3>FEDERAL PAROLE.</h3>

<p>The Attorney-General, Geo. W. Wickersham, delivered an
able address on the “Federal Parole,” now in operation at the
various federal prisons of the country.</p>

<p>“Punishment in some form is still necessary to prevent
crime. This is especially the case,” he added, “in a community
and at a time when divers economic forces are struggling
with each other for the mastery in the state, and where
laws are enacted through the influence of one class or classes
to control the action of another class who are unwilling to accept
them as rules of action, because unconvinced of the
wisdom or justice of the legislative policy which they embody.
Yet a consideration of the nature of social organization
will demonstrate the absolute necessity of all classes of
society conforming to requirements prescribed by the duly
constituted authorities&mdash;however wise or unwise those regulations
may appear to those whose conduct is sought to be
controlled by them. But within its constitutional scope the
acts of the legislature stand until repealed as the mandate of
organized society, and the continued effectiveness of organized
society requires that obedience to such laws be compelled.”</p>

<p>The attorney-general lengthily discussed the broad question
of punishment for crime and the administration of the
federal parole law.</p>

<p>Modern penal legislation, he said, is based on a recognition
of the expediency of endeavoring to reform the criminal,
and so great a stress has been laid on that feature in dealing
with criminals, that “we sometimes forget that in order that
punishment may act as a deterrent upon others it must appear
as a badge of disgrace, and not simply the bestowal of benevolence.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wickersham favored the extension of the parole law
to include life prisoners. He regarded as an incongruity that
prisoners sentenced to long terms for vicious crimes should
be eligible for parole, when the man convicted of second degree
murder must remain in prison for life.</p>

<p>“If the lawmaking power,” continued Mr. Wickersham,
“considers reformation, conditional liberation and reinstatement
to a normal position in society possible in these cases,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
‘it is difficult to say on what principle the same possibility and
hope of reformation, liberation and forgiveness should not be
extended to one guilty of murder under circumstances not
punishable by death. While there is life there should be hope.
It may be far off, delayed, a dim, distant possibility, but it
would seem that that hope should be held out as a possible attainment
to the meanest wretch who is allowed to live. The
justice of man should aim at the perfection of divine justice,
and though finite wisdom not knowing the hearts of men, may
not always deal justly with offenders, yet it should not “shut
the gates of mercy” against the meanest of God’s creatures.’”</p>

<p>Since the parole law was placed in operation last autumn,
the attorney-general said, but one prisoner had violated his
parole. The 200 prisoners who were paroled from the time
the law was put into effect in the autumn of 1910 to June 30,
earned nearly $22,000, whereas, if they had remained in
prison, the attorney-general pointed out, they would have
been a charge on the government.</p>

<p>Mr. Wickersham expressed the belief that the parole
boards should be enlarged by adding two unofficial persons
selected from among prominent citizens of the locality in which
the prison is situated.</p>

<p>The Federal Parole Law, approved 1910, provides that
any prisoner confined in any United States prison or penitentiary,
for a definite term of over one year, whose record of
conduct shows that he has observed the rules of such institution,
and who has served <i>one third</i> of the time for which
he was sentenced, may be released on parole as hereinafter
provided.... Nothing in the law is to be so construed as to
impair the power of the President to grant a pardon or to
commutation in any case, or in any way impair or revoke
such good-time allowance as is or may hereafter be provided
by Congress.</p>

<h3>PREVENTION.</h3>

<p>Governor Vessey of South Dakota took “Prevention”
for his theme, dealing with the topics of child labor, contact
with hardened criminals, lack of practical education in the
schools, and bad environment at home, principally brought
about by the curse of alcoholic drink.</p>

<p>“Child labor,” he said, “is a traffic in human souls, backed,
supported and sustained by an unjust greed for gold, and
though financially it may be profitable to the employer, it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
nevertheless a shameful sale of humanity for money, and that
such a cruel condition, with all its concomitant evils, should be
tolerated in this progressive age and in this fair land, exceeds
my understanding.</p>

<p>“But we are awaking from our dream of false commercialism
and the institution of child labor must pass.”</p>

<h3>PRISON REFORM LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA.</h3>

<p>Griffith J. Griffith, Secretary of the Prison Reform
League of Los Angeles, California, read an interesting paper
on “What the Prison Reform League Wants to Do and See
Done.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the question as to what we of the Prison Reform
League have in view will be answered best by stating at
the outset what we are not seeking. We are not attempting
to boost any party ‘ism,’ creed or private interest. We are
not endeavoring to inoculate the public with any new philosophy.
On the contrary, we conceive ourselves to be severely
practical people, who have noted a series of appalling facts
and wish to know how they agree with certain principles by
which society professes to be guided. We mark the startling
difference between theory and fact; we try to bring that difference
to the notice of those whom we can reach. All thinking
men and women acknowledge, as it appears to us, that
punishment can be justified only by the necessity of protecting
society and diminishing as far as possible the tendency toward
barbarism.</p>

<p>“We submit that every judge who passes what is called
an ‘exemplary’ sentence in the hope of checking crime; every
warden or jailer who excuses brutality toward prisoners with
the plea that they have been sent to jail for punishment; every
police officer who conceives it to be his role to terrify malefactors
by the display or exercise of force, is making the same
false argument as that by which the upholders of things as
they are seek to justify capital punishment. All these classes,
paid by society to protect it against crime, are in our view victims
of an utterly erroneous philosophy and intensify the very
evil they are hired to cure.</p>

<p>“We say that it never pays society to wrong the individual.
We say the state wrongs him inexpressibly when it
professes to seek his reform and debases him; that murder
cannot be abolished or diminished in volume by the state turning
murderer; that when the state compels a man to toil for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
it without remuneration it is itself a thief, and that such is
not the way to discourage theft; that if the poor, isolated, and
therefore helpless, individual has duties toward the all-powerful
state, infinitely greater are the duties of that almost omnipotent
organization toward the individual. We say that side
of the question has been overlooked, and we call attention to
it in the very sharpest terms at our command.”</p>

<h3>CAUSES OF CRIME.</h3>

<p>Under this general heading, Dr. William Healy, Director
of the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute of Chicago, read a
paper on “The Problem of the Causation of Criminality,” and
Dr. William Martin Richards, of New York, gave an address
on “Physical Defects as a Factor in the Making of Criminals.”
No synopsis of these papers can do them justice. They represent
the latest investigations along these lines, and when
published should be read by all who are interested in the betterment
of humanity. Dr. Healy recited numerous specific instances
of abnormal children whose lives were directly aimed
at defiance of law, because of physical or mental defects or
because of trivial circumstances, most of whom could be more
or less readily reformed when handled in a rational manner.</p>

<p>Dr. Richards dwelt on such defects as bad eyesight, nasal
imperfections, “flat foot,” and various spinal troubles, all of
which were responsible for criminal tendencies. He told of
some cases where the restoration of correct vision had resulted
in changing lives, criminally inclined, into right habits.</p>

<p>Frederick Howard Wines, the only charter member of
the Association present, said that in all the sessions he had
ever attended he had not heard two such illuminating addresses.</p>

<h3>COMMITTEE ON PRISON LABOR.</h3>

<p>Kate Barnard, of Oklahoma, introduced a resolution providing
for the appointment of a committee to study conditions
of convict labor. It is gratifying to report that it was finally
decided that the committee on organization at the next Annual
Meeting in 1912 shall include among the Standing Committees
a Committee on Prison Labor, whose duty shall be
to study the aspects of prison labor and to report definite
recommendations as to the most practical measures to be
adopted by the various states.</p>

<p>The new committee to investigate the subject of prison
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
labor will be composed of F. H. Mills, New York, Chairman;
Albert Garvin, Chesshire, Conn.; Samuel Gompers, Washington,
D. C.; Kate Barnard, Oklahoma City, Okla.; Dr. J. T.
Gilmour, Toronto, Can.; Joseph P. Byers, Secretary.</p>

<h3>DISCHARGED PRISONERS.</h3>

<p>Miss Eva Booth, Chairman of the Committee on Discharged
Prisoners, was unable to attend the convention, but
the report of the committee was read.</p>

<p>This was a paper by Miss Booth, reviewing the problem
of the discharged prisoner, urging that he must be understood
as an individual in order that he might be helped to get a new
footing in the world, and emphasizing the necessity of prison
visitation to enable the workers to know the prisoner when
he is liberated.</p>

<p>The parole system was commended and reference was
made to the plan recently advocated by General Booth in England
to have paroled prisoners make their reports to the Salvation
Army and other charitable institutions instead of to
the police departments.</p>

<p>Governor Folk’s plan of having the family of the prisoner
taken care of from the earnings of the convict’s labor was
commended.</p>

<h3>FIRST OFFENDERS.</h3>

<p>Eugene Smith, President of the Prison Association of
New York State, read a report on “Statistics of Crime.” His
report was embellished with illustrations showing that no statistics
of crime could be complete in giving an accurate account
of the amount of crime actually committed for obvious
reasons. The first crime of a trusted employé willing to make
restitution may be covered up, the disgrace to members of the
family, insanity, business reasons and other considerations tend
to cover up the criminal acts of many first offenders.</p>

<p>He favored the idea of treating the first offender so that
his criminal tendencies may be corrected if this is possible
under the supervision of a properly constituted Board of Supervisors.
He called attention to the cost of a man who was convicted
and sent to prison for killing his employer in a fit of
rage. His case was studied by prison physicians who believed
the man was living between the borders of sanity and insanity.
An operation was eventually decided on and a needle was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
removed from the brain. The man recovered his normal condition
of mind and was discharged from prison.</p>

<h3>ATTENDANCE&mdash;CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>The number of members and delegates in attendance was
385, forty-three states being represented, also Canada, Cuba
and the Philippine Islands. No one could attend these meetings
without being impressed that this Association has already
accomplished great service in improving penal conditions in
the United States, and that its influence is rapidly extending.
It is to be hoped that all barbaric methods of discipline will
soon be abolished, and that reformation of the criminal habit
will be the chief object of detention. We still believe in confinement
as a deterrent factor, but the renovation of character
is the goal for which our penal institutions should strive.</p>

<p>It should not be accepted as a criticism on the proceedings
of former meetings of the Association to say that the papers
and the discussions this year reached high water mark.</p>

<p>It was concluded to hold the next annual meeting in Baltimore
in the latter part of November, 1912.</p>

<p>The following officers were elected: President, Frederick
C. Pettigrove, Chairman Massachusetts Prison Commission;
Secretary, Joseph P. Byers, Newark, N. J.; Financial Secretary,
H. H. Shirer, Columbus, Ohio; Treasurer, Frederick H.
Mills, New York City.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">John H. Dillingham.</span></h3>

<p>John H. Dillingham, whose death occurred in Third
Month, 1910, joined the Prison Society in the Fifth Month
of the year 1882. He was elected a member of the Acting
Committee a few months after joining the Society, which
position he held until he was called to another and higher
field of usefulness in the world beyond.</p>

<p>Our brother was always much interested in the humanitarian
labors of the Society, and was a valuable visitor at the
Eastern Penitentiary until, owing to his many other duties,
he was obliged to discontinue that service.</p>

<p>As an evidence of his interest in and desire to help the
objects of our care, it may be stated that a short time before his
death he said it was his intention to resume his visits to them,
but the Lord, “whose he was and whom he served,” willed
otherwise, and the service will have to be performed by others.
His genial disposition, loving nature and conspicuous goodness
endeared him to all who knew him.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">David Sulzberger.</span></h3>

<p>David Sulzberger, a member of the Pennsylvania Prison
Society, and a member of the Acting Committee since 1903,
was born in the Duchy of Baden, in 1838, and died in March,
1910, at the home of his sister in this city.</p>

<p>Reared by pious parents of the Jewish faith, and following
the teachings of Jehovah, as manifested to one who sought
earnestly to know the Divine Will, he devoted much of his
life and means to practical philanthropy. It has been said by
a member of his own denomination that his crowning achievement
was his splendid service to the cause of humanity in
visiting the Jewish and other prisoners confined in the penal
institutions located in this city. He brought to them the consolation
of religion whenever they were amenable to its influence,
the moral strength that emanated from a firm yet
a kindly nature, the instruction that would give them a new
start in the battle of life. Scarcely a week passed for many
years without his visits to these prisoners, and at no time was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
he too busy to give his thought and attention to anything that
would help the prisoners with whom he came in contact.
Sometimes his kindness was abused, but that did not deter him
from the work. He was possessed of the saving grace of a
keen sense of humor that enabled him to take disappointments
of that kind philosophically, as a part of the day’s work, and
furthermore he was not hunting excuses to justify him in
stopping. He was simply seeking to lend a helping hand in
a field from which all but the stoutest of hearts are apt to be
repelled.</p>

<p>He was a Hebrew of the patriarchal type, and to him
Judaism was not merely a creed but a system of life, and with
scrupulous fidelity he observed the lofty precepts of that religion
which render it a sacred obligation on the part of its devotees
to help struggling humanity by their presence, by their sympathy,
by their means, in all the incidents of human life from
the cradle to the grave.</p>

<p>In an eminent degree he possessed the courage of his
convictions, and never for one moment shrunk from what
might be supposed to be a disagreeable duty, or from lifting
up his voice in high places in a protest against what he considered
wrongs which should be remedied.</p>

<p>His counsels will be greatly missed, and his loss seems
irreparable, but we have the assurance that he had fought a
good fight, that his lifework was accomplished, and we are
thankful that we have known him as a friend, and that we
have had the example of his strong devotion to duty.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mary S. Whelen.</span></h3>

<p>The passing away, on February 15, of Miss Mary S.
Whelen came as a distinct shock to her many friends and to
the class of Philadelphians interested in the welfare of the
Commonwealth and of the Municipality in one of its most
vital issues.</p>

<p>Although the part Miss Whelen played so effectively,
owing to her modesty, is known to but few, it deserves some
mention in order that others, inspired by the same motives,
may carry on the work to which she fearlessly and generously
devoted many years. She was intensely interested in the welfare
of prisoners convicted of crime, and as an active member
of the Board of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, visited our
prisons weekly, going into the cells, teaching many ignorant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
women to read and write. Her ear was ever open to explanations,
and her kindly intuition made it possible for her to discern
the motive which actuated a crime, and her advice and
consolation often brought repentance and the possibility of
better things. When the sentence expired, a woman having
no home or place to which to go, was taken from prison, personally,
by Miss Whelen to a destination where she might begin
a new life; and letters from these once degraded creatures
show in many instances reformation and warm expressions of
gratitude. She was a member of the Committee on Police
Matrons, and to this most beneficent service she gave practical
and efficient aid. All her generous, charitable deeds have
been accomplished so quietly and unostentatiously that it recalls
the beautiful admonition, “Let not thy right had know
what thy left hand doeth.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Robert Parker Nicholson.</span></h3>

<p>Robert P. Nicholson, whose death occurred in July, 1911,
as the result of an accident, had been a member of the Society
for a few years, but had served on the Acting Committee for
only a few months. His deep interest in the work gave
promise of much service on behalf of our cause. His genial
disposition had endeared him to a host of friends by whom he
is sadly missed.</p>

<p>“Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a

<p>Such was the passing of our beloved friend, John J.
Lytle, whose death occurred on the 14th of Eighth Month,
1911, at his residence in Moorestown, N. J.</p>

<p>He was born at Alexandria, Va., in 1823, and had almost
completed his eighty-eighth year. In his infancy his widowed
mother brought her family to Philadelphia, and for the remainder
of his life his residence was in or near that city. After
he attained his majority he was a merchant for twenty-five
years at the corner of Seventh and Spring Garden Streets.</p>

<p>Early in his business career he became deeply interested
in personal visitations to the inmates of the Eastern Penitentiary.
With the exception of Joshua L. Baily, President of the
Society, his membership in the Pennsylvania Prison Society
covered a period longer than that of any living member,
both having been elected members in 1851. For nearly sixty
years he was a member of the Acting Committee, and his
official positions date from the beginning of his membership
on the Acting Committee to the time of his death. Early in
1852 he was appointed Secretary of the Acting Committee,
and in 1860 he was elected Secretary of the Society. This
office he held till 1909, when, on account of the infirmities of
age, he was released from the active duties of this position
and appointed Honorary Secretary. From 1886 to 1908 he
gave up almost his entire time and energies to work on
behalf of prisoners. The Eastern Penitentiary was the
scene of his greatest efforts. Almost daily did he visit this
large institution, becoming personally acquainted with the
thirteen hundred or more inmates and ministering untiringly
to their physical and spiritual needs. He speaks of his great
privilege and “pleasure to stand by the prisoner’s side, to grasp
his hand, to put new life into his heart, to endeavor to restore
confidence in himself.” While he believed in all changes in
penal methods which are directed to the reformation of the
prisoners, and in industrial and scholastic training, he was
firmly convinced that the only sure basis of reformation was
the life-giving, renewing power of the gospel of Christ. To
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
this end he labored in season and out of season. He never
forgot the spiritual interests of those whom he befriended. In
his report for 1906 he says: “We must talk to the man in
the cell as a man, a friend and brother.... That lives redeemed
await the work of those who enter the prison cell with
the message of Christ is well proven. Many a one has said to
me&mdash;I believe in sincerity, ‘The best thing that ever happened
to me in my life was my sentence to the penitentiary.
Here I have found my Saviour, whom I knew not before.’”
This theme is dwelt on in all the eighteen reports which he
made after assuming the duties of General Secretary in 1886.
To illustrate his faithfulness in the performance of duty, in
a report made in his eighty-first year, he states that he had
made during the year, four hundred and fifty visits to the
Penitentiary (oftener than daily), and had conversed with
the inmates, either in the cells or at the cell doors, about forty-five
hundred times. “It is now fourteen years since my
whole time has been given up to this work, and my interest in
it grows from year to year.... I find there is an open door
for me to talk to them of their spiritual needs....”</p>

<p>He was a delegate, in 1886, to the American Prison Association,
and for twenty years thereafter he was usually in
attendance at the sessions of that body, taking an active part
in the proceedings and serving on its leading committees.</p>

<p>When the State Legislature, in 1895, discontinued the
appropriation of $3,000 per annum for the equipment and
support of prisoners discharged from the Eastern Penitentiary,
John J. Lytle solicited private contributions to continue
this aid, and so successful were his efforts that no prisoner
in need in all these years has been dismissed from that institution
without practical help and sympathetic attention. The
task of making these collections and of attending to every
minute detail of their distribution involved unremitting labor,
which he ceased not until bodily infirmity in his eighty-fifth
year compelled him to take a much-needed rest. From the
autumn of 1908 till the time of his death he was mostly confined
to his home and vicinity, but was able to maintain quite
a large correspondence and to enjoy the visits of his friends.
His genial, kindly disposition had endeared him to a large
circle of acquaintances, who deeply appreciated the privilege
of his intimacy. His interest in the cause of the prisoners
never flagged. The summons came while sitting at his writing
table by the side of his dear wife, who had been his faithful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
companion for more than sixty-two years. A stroke of paralysis,
then a few days of unconsciousness and all was over.</p>

<p>He was a birth-right member of the Society of Friends.
In 1849 he was married to Anna Reeve, and he is survived by
the widow, one son and four daughters.</p>

<h2>AN ACT</h2>

<p class="hang">To define rights and functions of official visitors of jails, penitentiaries,

removal.</p>

<p>Section I. Be it enacted, &amp;c., That any person designated by law to
be official visitor of any jail, penitentiary, or other penal or reformatory
institution, in this Commonwealth, maintained at the public expense, is
hereby authorized and empowered to enter and visit any such jail, penitentiary,
or other penal or reformatory institution, on any and every day,
including Sundays, between the hours of nine o’clock, ante meridian, and
five o’clock, post meridian; and not before nine o’clock, ante meridian,
or after five o’clock, post meridian, except with the special permission of
the warden, manager, overseer, or superintendent in charge of any such
jail, penitentiary, or other penal or reformatory institution.</p>

<p>Section 2. Upon any such visit of any official visitor to any such jail,
penitentiary, or other penal or reformatory institution, such visitor shall
have the right to interview privately any prisoner or inmate confined in
any such jail, penitentiary, or other penal or reformatory institution, and
for that purpose to enter the cell, room, or apartment wherein any such
prisoner or inmate shall be confined: Provided, however, That if any
warden, manager, overseer, superintendent, or person in charge of such
institution at the time of such visit, shall be of the opinion that such entry
by the official visitor into the cell, room, or apartment of such prisoner
or inmate would be dangerous to the discipline of the institution, then and
in that case the said warden, superintendent, overseer, manager, or person
in charge, may conduct any prisoner or inmate, with whom such official
visitor may desire a private interview, into such other cell, room, or apartment
within the institution as he may designate and there permit the
private interview between the official visitor and such prisoner or inmate
to take place: Provided further, however, That no official visitor shall
have the right or power of privately interviewing any such prisoner or
inmate except prisoners or inmates of the same sex as such official visitor.</p>

<p>Section 3. All powers, functions, and privileges heretofore belonging
to official visitors of jails, penitentiaries, and penal or reformatory institutions,
under the common statute laws, are hereby confirmed: Provided,
however, That no such official visitor shall have the right or power to give
or deliver to any prisoner or inmate of any such jail, penitentiary, or penal
or reformatory institution, during such visit, any chattel or object whatsoever,
except objects and articles of religious or moral instruction or use.</p>

<p>Section 4. If any such official visitor shall violate any of the prohibitions
herein contained, any warden, manager, overseer, or superintendent
of any such jail, penitentiary, penal or reformatory institution, may apply
to any court of common pleas in the county wherein such institution may
be situated, for a rule upon such visitor to show cause why he or she
should not be deprived of his or her office; and upon proof to the satisfaction
of said court being made, such court shall enter a decree against
such official visitor, depriving him or her of all rights, privileges, and
functions of official visitor.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
